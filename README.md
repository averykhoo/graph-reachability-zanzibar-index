# Directed Acyclic Graph Reachability Indexing

I can't find any literature on a graph reachability index that works exactly the way I want,
so here we go again on another yak-shaving exercise

## What is this

It should be some code that lets you index a directed acyclic graph and look up in constant-ish time:

* given two nodes `u` and `v`, whether there is a path from `u` to `v`
* given one node `u`, all nodes `v'` that have a path from `u`
* given one node `v`, all nodes `u'` that have a path to `v`

And it should allow addition and removal in about linear-ish time
(or constant-ish time, given some assumptions about the out-degree of nodes in the graph):

* adding an edge from `u` to `v`
* removing an edge from `u` to `v`
* adding a new node `u` with no incoming/outgoing edges
* removing a node `u` and all edges to/from `u`

And it should build an index from a given graph in no worse than quadratic time,
and shouldn't take any more than quadratic space.

## How does it work

Assuming it does actually work, the code should explain how it works.
If it doesn't work then this repo will probably be archived.

## Why does it work

### Starting with a trivial lookup table

Let's say I just want a basic reachability lookup table.
The rows and columns are every possible node, and the cells are `1` if there exists a path and `0` otherwise.
A DAG may be represented as such:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A --> B
    B --> C
    B --> D
    C --> E
    D --> E
    A --> E
```

|   | A | B | C | D | E |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A |   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| B |   |   | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| C |   |   |   |   | 1 |
| D |   |   |   |   | 1 |
| E |   |   |   |   |   |

Lookups are pretty trivial to accomplish with this sort of index.
Also, adding a new node `F` and an arrow `F -> D` would simply require adding a new row and column:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A --> B
    B --> C
    B --> D
    C --> E
    D --> E
    A --> E
    F --> D
```

|   | A | B | C | D | E | F |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A |   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |   |
| B |   |   | 1 | 1 | 1 |   |
| C |   |   |   |   | 1 |   |
| D |   |   |   |   | 1 |   |
| E |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| F |   |   |   | 1 | 1 |   |

And this operation simply copies the reachability of `D` onto `F`, also adding one entry from `F` to `D`.
But this index does not allow the deletion of edges[^footnote-edge-deletion-1],
since it can't possibly know which paths would be affected by an edge deletion.

[^footnote-edge-deletion-1]: It might be possible to delete both nodes in the edge,
then re-add all other unaffected edges?

## Overcomplicating things

Skippable section

The obvious trick to try would be to track which paths contain which edges.
This is clearly not a scalable approach, but it illustrates why the final approach works

todo: continue story another day

### A trick from working with MAFSAs

When you have a list of strings you could build a trie, but a MAFSA is even smaller (by definition, minimal).
But how to you keep track of string indices in a MAFSA?
The trick to this is simply counting how many total word ends there are after each node.

todo: either write something or reference

## Reference counting

When we add an edge (e.g. `B -> F`), all nodes reachable from `F` are added `B` and to all nodes that can reach `B`

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A --> B
    B --> C
    B --> D
    C --> E
    D --> E
    A --> E
    F --> D
    B --> F
```

|   | A | B | C | D | E | F |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A |   | 1 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 1 |
| B |   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 1 |
| C |   |   |   |   | 1 |   |
| D |   |   |   |   | 1 |   |
| E |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| F |   |   |   | 1 | 1 |   |

### Maintaining the invariant

* remember to multiply by the incoming path count
* the graph must remain acyclic
* we need to store edges too, since we can't trivially tell from the lookup table whether a given edge exists
    * it's possible but computationally kinda slow
* node deletion requires zero incoming and outgoing paths
    * delete all edges that touch the node first
    * remember to optimize node deletion in the index
* technically it should support multiple edges between the same two nodes

## Optimizations

* Building in reverse topo order / reverse DFS (on node exit not entry) with deduplication
    * if the graph edges have a different distribution then maybe there's no difference,
      or maybe topo sort would be faster?
    * or maybe it's better to fill in every other layer of the topo sort graph first, to minimize extra calls?
* node deletion works like deleting an edge from itself
* use a sparse matrix for the edges - if it's indexed twice, then lookups and reverse lookups are both constant time
    * something like a compressed adjacency matrix?
    * the index only includes nodes if there are edges
    * garbage collect whenever any node/edge is removed
* it's possible to figure out the edges from the original index (albeit in O(n**2) time with some kind of rref-like algo)
  so maybe if this index is written to disk we can avoid writing the edges?
    * basically sort the nodes by the number of outgoing edges, then starting from the most edges, start subtracting until it's zeroed

## Transactions

* use a database
* remove one edge at a time
* add one edge at a time
* make sure not to add any edges that were removed in the same transaction, or dedupe beforehand
* rollback if a cycle is detected
* both the edge store and the index should be in the same database
* nested transactions to support adding multiple edges together?
* optimization: single transaction, but will need multiple reads and a local cache before writing

## reducing the search space when traversing edges

* build a state machine
* filter by node type and edge type
* in the schema graph there should only be a few possible transitions
