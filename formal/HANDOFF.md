# HANDOFF.md — START HERE (the formal-verification entry point)

**A fresh session reads THIS FILE FIRST, top to bottom (~250 lines), then goes straight
to work on "The next task" below.** Pull in other docs only on demand:

| doc | what it's for | when to read |
|---|---|---|
| `PROOF_STATUS.md` | append-only session ledger (newest first) | the TOP entry only, for fine detail on the resume point |
| `ROADMAP.md` | per-stage designs + historical plans | the section for the stage you're working |
| `SEMANTICS.md` | the Phase-0 spec (`sem`, models, theorem statements) | when touching spec-level defs |
| `docs/formal-verification-plan.md` | original strategy/phases/honesty clauses | rarely; §7 for claim wording |
| `REVIEW.md` | historical one-shot session digest (2026-07-09→10) | never (history) |

**End goal:** a machine-checked proof that the set engine and graph index both compute
the stratified-Datalog¬ perfect model `sem` — hence are equivalent — with the Python
implementations pinned to the Lean models by the conformance harness. The honest claim
never rounds up to "the code is formally verified" (plan §7).

---

## House rules (non-negotiable, user-adjudicated)

1. **Honesty norm.** Never fake a proof, never postulate the thing being proven
   (no `check := sem` models, no invariant-as-postcondition). A documented `sorry`
   plus genuine infrastructure beats a fragile/unfaithful close. Never edit a
   golden/oracle/snapshot to make something pass.
2. **Attack first.** Before proving any NEW theorem statement, try to REFUTE it —
   concrete scenarios via `#eval` against the real `check`/`sem` (delete the scratch
   after recording the finding). This has killed five false statements so far
   (additive fuelBound, abstract WriteStep closure, T0a-sans-StoreDeclared, naive-W2
   TTU fragment, W3a single-edge collapse sans NoRuleOutputs). A session that kills a
   false statement is a GOOD session; record the finding.
3. **Green gate.** Every increment must keep `bash formal/verify.sh` green: lake build
   + **0 sorries** + zcli + axiom audit (only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`)
   + 60 Python conformance tests. Add new key theorems to `lean/ZanzibarProofs/Audit.lean`.
4. **Rhythm.** Commit each green increment with a `formal: <stage> — <what>` message;
   push at session end. Before ending: update this file's "The next task" + add a
   PROOF_STATUS.md session entry (top) + tick the ROADMAP stage marker.
5. **Faithfulness.** Model hypotheses must be faithful to the Python (cite file:line
   or the spec §). New fragment conditions need a comment saying what Python mechanism
   they mirror. Where a spec and the code disagree on a name, the code wins.
6. **Subagents** don't parallelize proof-closing (compiler-in-loop, deep coupling);
   use them only for read-only exploration/design.

## Build & verify

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.elan/bin:$PATH"                    # Lean v4.31.0, Mathlib pinned
cd formal/lean && lake build                            # library (incremental ~1 min)
lake build ZanzibarProofs.GraphIndex.ReconcileCorrect   # one module (~20 s)
bash formal/verify.sh                                   # THE gate (from repo root; ~5 min)
```

Python side runs under the repo conda env
(`C:/Users/avery/anaconda3/envs/graph-reachability-zanzibar-index/python.exe`).

**Lean/Mathlib gotchas (hard-won):** unfold plain defs with `unfold f` / `simp only [f]`,
not `rw [f]`. `omega` treats `∑`-atoms as opaque — good for combining sum `have`s.
`Finset.Ico` ← `Mathlib.Order.Interval.Finset.Nat`; big-operator ring lemmas ←
`Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Ring.Finset`; `ring` ← `Mathlib.Tactic.Ring`.
`NReaches` is head-oriented: back-append is `NReaches.tail`; back-REPLACE needs
last-edge surgery (`nreaches_last`, cf. `nreaches_relation_rewrite`).

| **T5** `runCascade_no_abort` / `cascade_drains` + `ReachedByW3d` | `GraphIndex/Cascade.lean` | W3d-1a: the scheduler in the model — logged writes, `affectedKeys`, the drain loop; reject branch provably dead at one stratum; `Quiescent` earned — RE-EARNED over the diffing pass (decision 7) |
| the DIFFING pass + per-key edge EXACTNESS | `GraphIndex/ReconcileDiff.lean` | W3d-1b groundwork: `reconcileStarsKeyD` (stale-edge retraction, `processor.py:359-367`), both-direction reach inertness, guard fold-invariance, `reconcileStarsKeyD_edge_char` (the re-settle as a theorem) |
| FAN-OUT COMPLETENESS + the untainted-core shadow + settledness transport | `GraphIndex/CascadeStable.lean` | W3d-1b core: `writeLeg_checkFn_stable` (unmapped keys' guards unchanged), `reachedByW3d_shadow`/`checkFn_eq_sem_w3d` (guard = `sem` at EVERY W3d state, incl. mid-batch), `writeLeg_sem_stable` (unmapped keys keep their MEANING), `SettledKey` + write-leg/untargeted-cascade transport |

| T2a **`reachedByW3dC_inv`** — the FULL 8-clause `Inv` (+ `reachedByW3d_structInv` / `reachedByW3d_residueHygienic` / `reachedByW3d_residueDeclared` / `reachedByW3dC_edgeHygienic`) | `GraphIndex/CascadeInv.lean` | W3d-1c piece A CLOSED: `Inv` at EVERY coverage-chain state (dirty keys, mid-drain included). Structural half + edge-free I6: NO fragment hyps. Edge-referencing I6 (`negEdgeFree`/`uposEdgeFree`): attack-REFUTED over the plain chain (stale non-candidate edge — the coverage clauses are load-bearing for the invariant itself, not just the read theorem); proved over `ReachedByW3dC` via row-key declaredness + the reach collapse + the `SettledKey` verdict clash at targeted keys |

**Staged T2 widening: W1 ✅ → W2 ✅ → W3a ✅ → W3b ✅ → W3c ✅ → W3d-1a ✅ → W3d-1b ✅ → W3d-1c ◐ (piece A `reachedByW3dC_inv` ✅ 2026-07-11j; piece B the audit enumeration remains) → W3d-2 → W4.**

**W3c is CLOSED (2026-07-11d).** Full detail: the 2026-07-11* PROOF_STATUS entries and the
ROADMAP W3c paragraphs. The pieces a W3d session will actually reuse:
- **Write model** (`ReconcileStars.lean`): `wildcardShapes` / `coveredFn` (star-subject
  `checkFn`) / `reconcileResidueKey` (wholesale stars+neg+upos recompute) / `reconcileKeyC`
  (covered-guarded edge fold) / `reconcileStarsKey` (residue-THEN-edges, the faithful atomic
  unit). Three structural devices: the **covered-filter collapse** (`reconcileKeyC_eq_filter` —
  the W3c edge fold IS a W3a `reconcileKey` on filtered candidates), the **shadow projection**
  (`reachedByW3c_shadow` — every W3c state has a W3a-admitted shadow with identical core), and
  **star-general operand-read inertness** (`graphRec_reconcileKey_inert`, no `StarFreeStore`).
  `reachedByW3c_master`: canonical base σ0 per chain — canonical `stars` rows + guard canonicity.
  T2a `reachedByW3c_inv` with ALL FOUR I6 clauses contentful.
- **Read half** (`ReconcileStarsComplete.lean`): `checkFn_eq_sem_w3c` (bridge on any W3c state);
  **the LINCHPIN `coveredFn_declared`** (no ghost star coverage: a `sem`-covered shape is
  DECLARED — first edge out of the `wAny` node is a materialised closure tuple whose star seed
  matched a wildcard-flagged restriction); `w3c_row_char` (persisted rows read at `sem` level);
  batch completeness for the WHOLESALE recompute (`reconcileJobsC_row_isSome`,
  `_neg_complete`/`_upos_complete` with the **∀-targeting-jobs enumeration form** — attack-
  confirmed necessary: a later same-key pass with an incomplete `negCands` drops the exclusion);
  `w3cComplete_derived_edge`; **`graph_correct_w3c`** (star ⇒ `stars`, bare ⇒ edge ∨ `stars`∖`neg`,
  userset ⇒ `upos` exactly — `hWSbare` kills userset coverage). Fragment hyps: `BareStarStore` +
  `TtuStarFree` + `hWSbare : ∀ sh ∈ wildcardShapes S, sh.2 = BARE` (decision-15) + the W3a/W3b
  carries (`hterm`/`hCO`/`hLU`/`hRootB`); query scope `hqs : name = STAR → predicate = BARE`,
  concrete object. T3/T6 `*_w3c` incl. `exclusion_effective_w3c` (a concrete subject excluded
  from UNDER a `T:*` grant — the space rule's `neg` actually excludes).

## The next task — W3d-1c piece B: the audit enumeration + discharge `W3dJobCoverage`

**Session 2026-07-11j CLOSED piece A — READ ITS PROOF_STATUS ENTRY.** The full 8-clause
T2a **`reachedByW3dC_inv`** now holds at EVERY coverage-chain state (dirty keys and
mid-drain states included), in `GraphIndex/CascadeInv.lean`. Attack finding worth
knowing: the plain-chain `reachedByW3d_inv` is FALSE (`#eval`-refuted, recorded in the
CascadeInv header) — a stale non-candidate edge survives the diff audit while a later
pass writes its holder into `neg`, so the edge-holder coverage clause is load-bearing
for the INVARIANT itself. The edge-clause proof shape: `reachedByW3d_residueDeclared`
(rows only at declared derived keys) + chain induction where write legs use
`writeLeg_derived_inedges_eq` + the reach collapse, targeted cascade keys use
`settledComplete_cascade_targeted` (a `SettledKey` row verdict contradicts its edge
verdict: `neg` member `sem`-false vs edge holder `sem`-true; `upos` member userset vs
bare source via `reachedByW3d_Rnode_source_bare`), untargeted keys use
`reconcileJobsD_other_key_fixed`.

**Second 11j finding: `W3dJobCoverage` clause (2) now carries an UNCOVERED guard**
(matching `CompleteKey`'s edge clause). Without it the clause was unsatisfiable by any
finite job on covering stores (every fresh unstored subject is `sem`-true under a
`T:*` grant — `#eval`-checked), so the coverage chain admitted NO cascade there and
the W3d theorems were vacuously narrow on exactly the stores W3c added. The weakening
makes every chain theorem strictly stronger; `settledComplete_cascade_targeted` needed
a one-token fix (`hnc` was already in scope). Build the piece-B enumeration against
the GUARDED clause.

**B. Model the audit enumeration + discharge `W3dJobCoverage`** (makes `graph_correct_w3d`
— and now also `reachedByW3dC_inv` — unconditional: the coverage is hypothesized today).
**Design pinned this session (read-only pass over `probeNonDerived`, `State.lean:535`):**

1. **Route (a) is the provable one — reach-based leaf concretes.** For a concrete
   subject `s`, each operand leaf read decomposes POINTWISE as
   `leaf(s) = leaf(starSubj s.shape) ∨ probe1(s) ∨ probe3(s)`: probes 2/4 of
   `probeNonDerived` (`wAny`-sourced) are exactly the star subject's own probes 1/3
   (`subjNode (starSubj sh) = wAnyNode sh`), and probes 1/3 are the concrete-specific
   ones (`σ.reach (subjNode s) (objNode ⟨dt,on⟩ r')` / `σ.reach (subjNode s)
   (wAllNode dt r')`). So define `leafConcretes σ dt on e` := plain star-free nodes
   `u ∈ σ.nodes` with reach into `objNode ⟨dt,on⟩ r'` OR `wAllNode dt r'` for some
   `r' ∈ computedRefs e`, decoded to `⟨u.type, u.name, u.pred⟩` (`nodeEnc` from
   `StructInv` makes decode ∘ `subjNode` = id on plain nodes).
2. **The KEY LEMMA (`checkFn_eq_coveredFn_of_no_extra`)**: if `s` triggers NO
   concrete-specific probe at any leaf of `e` (`ComputedOnly` scopes `rec` calls to
   `(dt, on, r')`), then `checkFn σ T s dt on R e = coveredFn σ T dt on R e s.shape`
   by `evalE` congruence in `rec` — NO monotonicity argument needed (booleans equal
   pointwise ⇒ equal, exclusion-safe). All three completeness clauses become
   contrapositives of the bridge `checkFn = sem` (`checkFn_eq_sem_w3d`) at the leg
   state:
   * clause (2): uncovered ∧ `sem`-true ⇒ (if not enumerated) `checkFn = covered =
     false` ⇒ `sem` false, contradiction;
   * clause (3): covered ∧ `sem`-false ⇒ (if not enumerated) `checkFn = covered =
     true` ⇒ `sem` true, contradiction;
   * clause (4): userset `sem`-true ⇒ (if not enumerated) `checkFn = coveredFn` of
     the USERSET shape, which is FALSE on the fragment (no userset-star seeds under
     `BareStarStore` — needs a small dead-`wAny`-node lemma: `wAnyNode (t, p≠BARE)`
     has no out-reach on the chain) ⇒ `sem` false, contradiction. NB the bridge is
     applied to `s` itself (star-free), never to the userset star subject.
3. `cands :=` bare-star-free `leafConcretes` ∪ decoded R-node in-edge sources
   (clause (1) by construction; `reachedByW3d_Rnode_source_bare` keeps the bare
   filter honest — may need the star-free analog `Rnode_source_name_ne_star`, same
   induction, candidates are `W3cJobValid`-star-free); `negCands :=` bare
   `leafConcretes` ∪ persisted `neg`; `uposCands :=` userset `leafConcretes` ∪
   persisted `upos` (the persisted parts mirror Python; the proofs above don't need
   them). `W3cJobValid` for the built job: shape filters by construction; `R ≠ BARE`
   from the derived key; `isDerived`/`lookup`/`on ≠ STAR` from the key.
4. **Restate**: an "enumerated cascade" (jobs built per dirty key) satisfies
   `hjv`/`hcover`/`hscope`/`hcovg`, so `ReachedByW3dC.cascade` applies — add the
   fully-operational chain corollary and restate `graph_correct_w3d` /
   `reachedByW3dC_inv` over it.

Fragment carries: `hterm`/`hCO`/`hLU`/`hRootB`/`hWSbare` + `BareStarStore`/`TtuStarFree`
+ W2 carries; add-only STORE (decision 6). House rule 6: subagents only for read-only
exploration.

---

## After W3d (the remaining road)
- **W4 — full-scope restatement.** Combine W1+W2+W3 generality; name the closure
  `ReachedBy`; restate `graph_correct` / `graph_reached_inv` / `backend_equivalence` /
  T6a/T6b over it at `GraphAccepts` scope (discharges the deleted-as-false abstract
  obligations). Carry: `NodupKeys`, `RewriteRanked`, `TtuTuplesetsDirect`, `hterm`
  (re-examine which W3a terminality conditions W4 must relax — `PDerivedTTU`/
  `PDerivedUserset` shapes were deferred).
- **Phase 6 — hardening.** (a) graph-model conformance extension: drive the Lean
  `writeDirect`/`check` model against the PYTHON graph index over the fragment corpora
  (zcli already exists for `sem`; add a graph-state mode); (b) `CORRESPONDENCE.md`
  (Lean def ↔ Python file:line map); (c) final review doc using plan §7 wording
  verbatim.

Historical detail for every closed stage: `PROOF_STATUS.md` (ledger, newest first)
and `ROADMAP.md` (designs + post-mortems).
