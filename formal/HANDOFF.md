# HANDOFF.md — START HERE (the formal-verification entry point)

**A fresh session reads THIS FILE FIRST, top to bottom (~250 lines), then goes straight
to work on "The next task" below.** Pull in other docs only on demand:

| doc | what it's for | when to read |
|---|---|---|
| `PROOF_STATUS.md` | append-only session ledger (newest first) | the TOP entry only, for fine detail on the resume point |
| `ROADMAP.md` | per-stage designs + historical plans | the section for the stage you're working |
| `SEMANTICS.md` | the Phase-0 spec (`sem`, models, theorem statements) | when touching spec-level defs |
| `docs/formal-verification-plan.md` | original strategy/phases/honesty clauses | rarely; §7 for claim wording |
| `REVIEW.md` | historical one-shot session digest (2026-07-09→10) | never (history) |

**End goal:** a machine-checked proof that the set engine and graph index both compute
the stratified-Datalog¬ perfect model `sem` — hence are equivalent — with the Python
implementations pinned to the Lean models by the conformance harness. The honest claim
never rounds up to "the code is formally verified" (plan §7).

---

## House rules (non-negotiable, user-adjudicated)

1. **Honesty norm.** Never fake a proof, never postulate the thing being proven
   (no `check := sem` models, no invariant-as-postcondition). A documented `sorry`
   plus genuine infrastructure beats a fragile/unfaithful close. Never edit a
   golden/oracle/snapshot to make something pass.
2. **Attack first.** Before proving any NEW theorem statement, try to REFUTE it —
   concrete scenarios via `#eval` against the real `check`/`sem` (delete the scratch
   after recording the finding). This has killed five false statements so far
   (additive fuelBound, abstract WriteStep closure, T0a-sans-StoreDeclared, naive-W2
   TTU fragment, W3a single-edge collapse sans NoRuleOutputs). A session that kills a
   false statement is a GOOD session; record the finding.
3. **Green gate.** Every increment must keep `bash formal/verify.sh` green: lake build
   + **0 sorries** + zcli + axiom audit (only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`)
   + 60 Python conformance tests. Add new key theorems to `lean/ZanzibarProofs/Audit.lean`.
4. **Rhythm.** Commit each green increment with a `formal: <stage> — <what>` message;
   push at session end. Before ending: update this file's "The next task" + add a
   PROOF_STATUS.md session entry (top) + tick the ROADMAP stage marker.
5. **Faithfulness.** Model hypotheses must be faithful to the Python (cite file:line
   or the spec §). New fragment conditions need a comment saying what Python mechanism
   they mirror. Where a spec and the code disagree on a name, the code wins.
6. **Subagents** don't parallelize proof-closing (compiler-in-loop, deep coupling);
   use them only for read-only exploration/design.

## Build & verify

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.elan/bin:$PATH"                    # Lean v4.31.0, Mathlib pinned
cd formal/lean && lake build                            # library (incremental ~1 min)
lake build ZanzibarProofs.GraphIndex.ReconcileCorrect   # one module (~20 s)
bash formal/verify.sh                                   # THE gate (from repo root; ~5 min)
```

Python side runs under the repo conda env
(`C:/Users/avery/anaconda3/envs/graph-reachability-zanzibar-index/python.exe`).

**Lean/Mathlib gotchas (hard-won):** unfold plain defs with `unfold f` / `simp only [f]`,
not `rw [f]`. `omega` treats `∑`-atoms as opaque — good for combining sum `have`s.
`Finset.Ico` ← `Mathlib.Order.Interval.Finset.Nat`; big-operator ring lemmas ←
`Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Ring.Finset`; `ring` ← `Mathlib.Tactic.Ring`.
`NReaches` is head-oriented: back-append is `NReaches.tail`; back-REPLACE needs
last-edge surgery (`nreaches_last`, cf. `nreaches_relation_rewrite`).

| T2a `reachedByW3c_inv` / `reachedByW3c_master` | `GraphIndex/ReconcileStars.lean` | W3c write half: `stars`/`neg` model, ALL I6 clauses contentful, star-general (no `StarFreeStore`) |
| T2b `graph_correct_rulesBS` | `GraphIndex/RulesBareStar.lean` | W2 untainted correspondence over `BareStarStore`+`TtuStarFree`, star-BARE subjects incl. |

| T2b `graph_correct_w3c` + `coveredFn_declared` (the linchpin) + `w3c_row_char` + batch completeness | `ReconcileStarsComplete.lean` | + star-carrying stores: bare `T:*` grants, `stars`/`neg`/`upos` reads, bare/star-BARE/userset subjects |
| T3/T6 `backend_equivalence*` / `exclusion_effective*` / `no_ghost_grant*` | `Equiv.lean` | per-fragment corollaries (incl. `_w3a`, `_w3b`, `_w3c`) |
| **T5** `runCascade_no_abort` / `cascade_drains` + `ReachedByW3d` | `GraphIndex/Cascade.lean` | W3d-1a: the scheduler in the model — logged writes, `affectedKeys`, the drain loop; reject branch provably dead at one stratum; `Quiescent` earned — RE-EARNED over the diffing pass (decision 7) |
| the DIFFING pass + per-key edge EXACTNESS | `GraphIndex/ReconcileDiff.lean` | W3d-1b groundwork: `reconcileStarsKeyD` (stale-edge retraction, `processor.py:359-367`), both-direction reach inertness, guard fold-invariance, `reconcileStarsKeyD_edge_char` (the re-settle as a theorem) |
| FAN-OUT COMPLETENESS + the untainted-core shadow + settledness transport | `GraphIndex/CascadeStable.lean` | W3d-1b core: `writeLeg_checkFn_stable` (unmapped keys' guards unchanged), `reachedByW3d_shadow`/`checkFn_eq_sem_w3d` (guard = `sem` at EVERY W3d state, incl. mid-batch), `writeLeg_sem_stable` (unmapped keys keep their MEANING), `SettledKey` + write-leg/untargeted-cascade transport |
| T2b **`graph_correct_w3d`** + the settledness invariant + targeted RE-settlement | `GraphIndex/CascadeSettle.lean` | W3d-1b CLOSED: `ReachedByW3dC` (coverage chain: per-job `W3dJobCoverage`, attack-confirmed edge-holder clause), `settledComplete_cascade_targeted`, `CompleteKey` + transports, `reachedByW3dC_settled` (dirty-or-settled at EVERY state), the W3d reach collapse, `check = sem` at every fully-drained (`cascadeKeys = []`) state; T3/T6 `*_w3d` |
| T2a **`reachedByW3dC_inv`** — the FULL 8-clause `Inv` (+ `reachedByW3d_structInv` / `reachedByW3d_residueHygienic` / `reachedByW3d_residueDeclared` / `reachedByW3dC_edgeHygienic`) | `GraphIndex/CascadeInv.lean` | W3d-1c piece A CLOSED: `Inv` at EVERY coverage-chain state (dirty keys, mid-drain included). Structural half + edge-free I6: NO fragment hyps. Edge-referencing I6 (`negEdgeFree`/`uposEdgeFree`): attack-REFUTED over the plain chain (stale non-candidate edge — the coverage clauses are load-bearing for the invariant itself, not just the read theorem); proved over `ReachedByW3dC` via row-key declaredness + the reach collapse + the `SettledKey` verdict clash at targeted keys |

Spine: a star-free subject's operand leaf reads decompose pointwise as star-read ∨ two concrete probes (`probeNonDerived_concrete_decomp`); a subject hitting neither probe reads exactly as its shape-star (`evalE` congruence, exclusion-safe). `w3d_leg_context` rebuilds the read bridge + coverage-declaredness at any W3d state via the shadow. REMAINING (piece B tail): the enumerated-cascade restatement — `W3cJobValid` of `enumJob` + `hcover`/`hscope`, then restate `graph_correct_w3d`/`reachedByW3dC_inv` unconditionally |

**Staged T2 widening: W1 ✅ → W2 ✅ → W3a ✅ → W3b ✅ → W3c ✅ → W3d-1a ✅ → W3d-1b ✅ → W3d-1c ◐ (piece A `reachedByW3dC_inv` ✅ 2026-07-11j; piece B core `w3dJobCoverage_enumJob` ✅ 2026-07-12 — the enumerated-cascade restatement remains) → W3d-2 → W4.**

**W3c is CLOSED (2026-07-11d).** Full detail: the 2026-07-11* PROOF_STATUS entries and the
ROADMAP W3c paragraphs. The pieces a W3d session will actually reuse:
- **Write model** (`ReconcileStars.lean`): `wildcardShapes` / `coveredFn` (star-subject
  `checkFn`) / `reconcileResidueKey` (wholesale stars+neg+upos recompute) / `reconcileKeyC`
  (covered-guarded edge fold) / `reconcileStarsKey` (residue-THEN-edges, the faithful atomic
  unit). Three structural devices: the **covered-filter collapse** (`reconcileKeyC_eq_filter` —
  the W3c edge fold IS a W3a `reconcileKey` on filtered candidates), the **shadow projection**
  (`reachedByW3c_shadow` — every W3c state has a W3a-admitted shadow with identical core), and
  **star-general operand-read inertness** (`graphRec_reconcileKey_inert`, no `StarFreeStore`).
  `reachedByW3c_master`: canonical base σ0 per chain — canonical `stars` rows + guard canonicity.
  T2a `reachedByW3c_inv` with ALL FOUR I6 clauses contentful.
- **Read half** (`ReconcileStarsComplete.lean`): `checkFn_eq_sem_w3c` (bridge on any W3c state);
  **the LINCHPIN `coveredFn_declared`** (no ghost star coverage: a `sem`-covered shape is
  DECLARED — first edge out of the `wAny` node is a materialised closure tuple whose star seed
  matched a wildcard-flagged restriction); `w3c_row_char` (persisted rows read at `sem` level);
  batch completeness for the WHOLESALE recompute (`reconcileJobsC_row_isSome`,
  `_neg_complete`/`_upos_complete` with the **∀-targeting-jobs enumeration form** — attack-
  confirmed necessary: a later same-key pass with an incomplete `negCands` drops the exclusion);
  `w3cComplete_derived_edge`; **`graph_correct_w3c`** (star ⇒ `stars`, bare ⇒ edge ∨ `stars`∖`neg`,
  userset ⇒ `upos` exactly — `hWSbare` kills userset coverage). Fragment hyps: `BareStarStore` +
  `TtuStarFree` + `hWSbare : ∀ sh ∈ wildcardShapes S, sh.2 = BARE` (decision-15) + the W3a/W3b
  carries (`hterm`/`hCO`/`hLU`/`hRootB`); query scope `hqs : name = STAR → predicate = BARE`,
  concrete object. T3/T6 `*_w3c` incl. `exclusion_effective_w3c` (a concrete subject excluded
  from UNDER a `T:*` grant — the space rule's `neg` actually excludes).

## The next task — W3d-1c piece B TAIL: the enumerated-cascade restatement

**Session 2026-07-12 landed piece B CORE — READ ITS PROOF_STATUS ENTRY.** `W3dJobCoverage`
is now a THEOREM (`w3dJobCoverage_enumJob`, all in `GraphIndex/CascadeEnum.lean`,
sorry-free, axiom-clean, verify.sh green), not a chain-side hypothesis. What's DONE:
- **The collapse spine** (fully proved): `probeNonDerived_concrete_decomp` (per-leaf
  pointwise decomposition `leaf(s) = leaf(starSubj s.shape) ∨ probe1(s) ∨ probe3(s)`)
  → `checkFn_eq_coveredFn_of_no_extra` (a subject hitting no concrete-specific probe
  reads as its shape-star; `evalE` congruence, exclusion-safe).
- **The enumeration**: `leafConcretes` (plain star-free nodes hitting a computed-leaf
  target, decoded by `nodeSubj`; `nodeSubj_subjNode : nodeSubj (subjNode s) = s` for
  EVERY `s`), `mem_leafConcretes_of_hit` / `no_extra_of_not_mem` /
  `checkFn_eq_coveredFn_of_not_mem`, and `edgeHolders` / `mem_edgeHolders`.
- **The leg context** `w3d_leg_context`: reconstructs `hbridge` (`checkFn_eq_sem_w3d`)
  and `hcovDecl` (a `sem`-covered star's shape is declared — `coveredFn_declared`
  lifted across the shadow via `checkFn_agree_of_graphRec` + `shadow_graphRec_agree`)
  at ANY `ReachedByW3d` state.
- **The four clause discharges** (`cands_complete_uncovered`, `negCands_complete`,
  `uposCands_complete`, `mem_edgeHolders`), each a contrapositive of `hbridge` through
  the collapse — note clause (4) uses `hcovDecl`'s contrapositive for the dead userset
  coverage (no new `wAny`-node lemma was needed after all), and `enumJob` +
  `w3dJobCoverage_enumJob` assemble them.

**THE TAIL — the enumerated-cascade restatement** (makes `graph_correct_w3d` /
`reachedByW3dC_inv` UNCONDITIONAL — today they still take `h : ReachedByW3dC` whose
`cascade` legs *assume* `W3dJobCoverage`; the goal is a chain whose legs are BUILT from
`enumJob` so coverage is discharged, not assumed):

1. **`W3cJobValid (enumJob σ dt on R e)`** — the one genuinely new lemma needed:
   * `cands`/`negCands`/`uposCands` shape filters hold by construction for the
     `leafConcretes`-filtered parts; the `edgeHolders` part of `cands` needs
     **bareness** (`reachedByW3d_Rnode_source_bare` — EXISTS, gives `x.pred = BARE` for
     `(x, R-node) ∈ edges`) and **star-freeness** (`x.name ≠ STAR` — the star-free
     analog `reachedByW3d_Rnode_source_name_ne_star` does NOT exist yet; prove it by
     the SAME induction as `_source_bare`, `CascadeSettle.lean:135`: write legs via
     `writeLeg_derived_inedges_eq`, cascade via `reconcileJobsD_edge_sound` where the
     job candidate is `W3cJobValid`-star-free). Decode: `nodeSubj x = ⟨x.type, x.name,
     x.pred⟩`, so `.predicate = x.pred`, `.name = x.name`.
   * `R ≠ BARE` from the derived key (need `isDerived (dt,R) → R ≠ BARE`); `isDerived` /
     `lookup` / `on ≠ STAR` from the key. **Check** what `cascadeKeys S σ` actually
     guarantees about each `(dt, R, on)` (derivedness? `on ≠ STAR`?) — read
     `affectedKeys` (`Cascade.lean`); `cascadeKeys` returns `(dt, R, on)` triples
     (note the `(dt, R, on)` order, `W3cJob.key`), `enumJob` takes `(dt, on, R)`.
2. **Build the cascade**: `jobs := (cascadeKeys S σ).map (fun k => enumJob σ k.1 k.2.2
   k.2.1 (lookup‥))` (mind the tuple order + fetching `e` from `S.lookup`). Then
   `hcover` (every dirty key has a job — `List.mem_map`), `hscope` (`W3cJob.key
   (enumJob …) ∈ cascadeKeys` — by construction), `hjv` (step 1), `hcovg`
   (`w3dJobCoverage_enumJob`, DONE). So `ReachedByW3dC.cascade` applies with all four
   legs discharged.
3. **Restate**: define the fully-operational chain (write legs + enumerated cascades)
   or a corollary "any `Quiescent`/`cascadeKeys = []` reachable-by-writes-and-
   enumerated-cascades state", and restate `graph_correct_w3d` / `reachedByW3dC_inv`
   over it with NO `W3dJobCoverage` hypothesis. Then W3d-1c is fully CLOSED.

Fragment carries: `hterm`/`hCO`/`hLU`/`hRootB`/`hWSbare` + `BareStarStore`/`TtuStarFree`
+ W2 carries; add-only STORE (decision 6). House rule 6: subagents only for read-only
exploration.

**After the tail → W3d-2** (two strata, derived-reading-derived — `probeDerived` leaf
dispatch, `rounds = 2`), then **W4** (full-scope restatement), then **Phase 6**.

---

## After W3d (the remaining road)
- **W4 — full-scope restatement.** Combine W1+W2+W3 generality; name the closure
  `ReachedBy`; restate `graph_correct` / `graph_reached_inv` / `backend_equivalence` /
  T6a/T6b over it at `GraphAccepts` scope (discharges the deleted-as-false abstract
  obligations). Carry: `NodupKeys`, `RewriteRanked`, `TtuTuplesetsDirect`, `hterm`
  (re-examine which W3a terminality conditions W4 must relax — `PDerivedTTU`/
  `PDerivedUserset` shapes were deferred).
- **Phase 6 — hardening.** (a) graph-model conformance extension: drive the Lean
  `writeDirect`/`check` model against the PYTHON graph index over the fragment corpora
  (zcli already exists for `sem`; add a graph-state mode); (b) `CORRESPONDENCE.md`
  (Lean def ↔ Python file:line map); (c) final review doc using plan §7 wording
  verbatim.

Historical detail for every closed stage: `PROOF_STATUS.md` (ledger, newest first)
and `ROADMAP.md` (designs + post-mortems).
