# HANDOFF.md — START HERE (the formal-verification entry point)

**A fresh session reads THIS FILE FIRST, top to bottom (~250 lines), then goes straight
to work on "The next task" below.** Pull in other docs only on demand:

| doc | what it's for | when to read |
|---|---|---|
| `PROOF_STATUS.md` | append-only session ledger (newest first) | the TOP entry only, for fine detail on the resume point |
| `ROADMAP.md` | per-stage designs + historical plans | the section for the stage you're working |
| `SEMANTICS.md` | the Phase-0 spec (`sem`, models, theorem statements) | when touching spec-level defs |
| `docs/formal-verification-plan.md` | original strategy/phases/honesty clauses | rarely; §7 for claim wording |
| `REVIEW.md` | historical one-shot session digest (2026-07-09→10) | never (history) |

**End goal:** a machine-checked proof that the set engine and graph index both compute
the stratified-Datalog¬ perfect model `sem` — hence are equivalent — with the Python
implementations pinned to the Lean models by the conformance harness. The honest claim
never rounds up to "the code is formally verified" (plan §7).

---

## House rules (non-negotiable, user-adjudicated)

1. **Honesty norm.** Never fake a proof, never postulate the thing being proven
   (no `check := sem` models, no invariant-as-postcondition). A documented `sorry`
   plus genuine infrastructure beats a fragile/unfaithful close. Never edit a
   golden/oracle/snapshot to make something pass.
2. **Attack first.** Before proving any NEW theorem statement, try to REFUTE it —
   concrete scenarios via `#eval` against the real `check`/`sem` (delete the scratch
   after recording the finding). This has killed five false statements so far
   (additive fuelBound, abstract WriteStep closure, T0a-sans-StoreDeclared, naive-W2
   TTU fragment, W3a single-edge collapse sans NoRuleOutputs). A session that kills a
   false statement is a GOOD session; record the finding.
3. **Green gate.** Every increment must keep `bash formal/verify.sh` green: lake build
   + **0 sorries** + zcli + axiom audit (only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`)
   + 60 Python conformance tests. Add new key theorems to `lean/ZanzibarProofs/Audit.lean`.
4. **Rhythm.** Commit each green increment with a `formal: <stage> — <what>` message;
   push at session end. Before ending: update this file's "The next task" + add a
   PROOF_STATUS.md session entry (top) + tick the ROADMAP stage marker.
5. **Faithfulness.** Model hypotheses must be faithful to the Python (cite file:line
   or the spec §). New fragment conditions need a comment saying what Python mechanism
   they mirror. Where a spec and the code disagree on a name, the code wins.
6. **Subagents** don't parallelize proof-closing (compiler-in-loop, deep coupling);
   use them only for read-only exploration/design.

## Build & verify

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.elan/bin:$PATH"                    # Lean v4.31.0, Mathlib pinned
cd formal/lean && lake build                            # library (incremental ~1 min)
lake build ZanzibarProofs.GraphIndex.ReconcileCorrect   # one module (~20 s)
bash formal/verify.sh                                   # THE gate (from repo root; ~5 min)
```

Python side runs under the repo conda env
(`C:/Users/avery/anaconda3/envs/graph-reachability-zanzibar-index/python.exe`).

**Lean/Mathlib gotchas (hard-won):** unfold plain defs with `unfold f` / `simp only [f]`,
not `rw [f]`. `omega` treats `∑`-atoms as opaque — good for combining sum `have`s.
`Finset.Ico` ← `Mathlib.Order.Interval.Finset.Nat`; big-operator ring lemmas ←
`Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Ring.Finset`; `ring` ← `Mathlib.Tactic.Ring`.
`NReaches` is head-oriented: back-append is `NReaches.tail`; back-REPLACE needs
last-edge surgery (`nreaches_last`, cf. `nreaches_relation_rewrite`).

| **T5** `runCascade_no_abort` / `cascade_drains` + `ReachedByW3d` | `GraphIndex/Cascade.lean` | W3d-1a: the scheduler in the model — logged writes, `affectedKeys`, the drain loop; reject branch provably dead at one stratum; `Quiescent` earned — RE-EARNED over the diffing pass (decision 7) |
| the DIFFING pass + per-key edge EXACTNESS | `GraphIndex/ReconcileDiff.lean` | W3d-1b groundwork: `reconcileStarsKeyD` (stale-edge retraction, `processor.py:359-367`), both-direction reach inertness, guard fold-invariance, `reconcileStarsKeyD_edge_char` (the re-settle as a theorem) |
| FAN-OUT COMPLETENESS + the untainted-core shadow + settledness transport | `GraphIndex/CascadeStable.lean` | W3d-1b core: `writeLeg_checkFn_stable` (unmapped keys' guards unchanged), `reachedByW3d_shadow`/`checkFn_eq_sem_w3d` (guard = `sem` at EVERY W3d state, incl. mid-batch), `writeLeg_sem_stable` (unmapped keys keep their MEANING), `SettledKey` + write-leg/untargeted-cascade transport |
| T2b **`graph_correct_w3d`** + the settledness invariant + targeted RE-settlement | `GraphIndex/CascadeSettle.lean` | W3d-1b CLOSED: `ReachedByW3dC` (coverage chain: per-job `W3dJobCoverage`, attack-confirmed edge-holder clause), `settledComplete_cascade_targeted`, `CompleteKey` + transports, `reachedByW3dC_settled` (dirty-or-settled at EVERY state), the W3d reach collapse, `check = sem` at every fully-drained (`cascadeKeys = []`) state; T3/T6 `*_w3d` |
| T2a **`reachedByW3dC_inv`** — the FULL 8-clause `Inv` (+ `reachedByW3d_structInv` / `reachedByW3d_residueHygienic` / `reachedByW3d_residueDeclared` / `reachedByW3dC_edgeHygienic`) | `GraphIndex/CascadeInv.lean` | W3d-1c piece A CLOSED: `Inv` at EVERY coverage-chain state (dirty keys, mid-drain included). Structural half + edge-free I6: NO fragment hyps. Edge-referencing I6 (`negEdgeFree`/`uposEdgeFree`): attack-REFUTED over the plain chain (stale non-candidate edge — the coverage clauses are load-bearing for the invariant itself, not just the read theorem); proved over `ReachedByW3dC` via row-key declaredness + the reach collapse + the `SettledKey` verdict clash at targeted keys |
| **`w3dJobCoverage_enumJob`** (+ the collapse `checkFn_eq_coveredFn_of_no_extra`, `leafConcretes`/`edgeHolders`, per-clause discharges, `w3d_leg_context`) | `GraphIndex/CascadeEnum.lean` | W3d-1c piece B CORE: **`W3dJobCoverage` is now a THEOREM** of a state-derived enumeration (was a chain-side hypothesis). Spine: a star-free subject's operand leaf reads decompose pointwise as star-read ∨ two concrete probes (`probeNonDerived_concrete_decomp`); a subject hitting neither probe reads exactly as its shape-star (`evalE` congruence, exclusion-safe). `w3d_leg_context` rebuilds the read bridge + coverage-declaredness at any W3d state via the shadow |

| the ROUTED leaf dispatch + conservativity + the TWO-ROUND scheduler | `GraphIndex/CascadeStrata.lean` | W3d-2 OPENING: `graphRecR`/`checkFnR`/`coveredFnR` (every operand leaf reads the graph's own `check` — untainted ⇒ `probeNonDerived`, derived ⇒ `probeDerived`; `processor.py:43-70, 182-188`), `checkFnR_eq_checkFn` (conservativity: on untainted-operand defs the routed read IS the W3d read), `checkFnR_evalEq` (the routed read consults exactly the `EvalEq` core — residue+schema now included), the routed diffing pass + `reconcileJobsLR_eq` (W3d-1 is the single-stratum image of the routed scheduler), `runCascade2` (rounds = 2, per-round frontier cursor, leftover reject), `ReachedByW3d2` (C-style two-batch closure), `reachedByW3d2_schema`. Attack-first: fully-drained `check = sem` SURVIVED all cross-stratum vectors; mid-drain staleness real; within-round order not load-bearing |
| **T5 at TWO STRATA** — `runCascade2_no_abort` / `cascade2_drains` + the W3d-2 structural layer | `GraphIndex/CascadeStrata.lean` | W3d-2 items 1–2 (2026-07-12d): routed-batch outbox/edge soundness (`reconcileJobsLR_outbox_sound`/`_edge_sound`), R-node terminality over the two-round closure (+ the round-STACKABLE batch transport), cursor arithmetic (`outbox_le_frontierMax` — a round's read is exhaustive). The reject branch provably dead under **`hLU2`** (two-stratum condition, dependency-wise; strictly wider than `hLU`, `hLU2_of_hLU`); attack-confirmed load-bearing (3-stratum schema ⇒ `hLU2` FALSE and the reject FIRES) |
| **per-stratum operand-read INERTNESS** — `check_reconcileStarsKeyDR_other` / `checkFnR_reconcileStarsKeyDR_other` | `GraphIndex/CascadeStrata.lean` | W3d-2 item 3a (2026-07-12d): a routed pass is read-inert at every OTHER key WHATEVER its stratum (untainted probe via `graphRec_reconcileStarsKeyDR_inert`, derived read via `probeDerived_reconcileStarsKeyDR_other` — node inequality from key inequality; guard form via `evalE_computedOnly`), on routed mirrors of the W3d-1b reach-inertness/closure/residue-other layer. The base fact for the stratum-staged settledness transport |
| **the W3d2 SHADOW + the stratum-staged READ BRIDGE + settledness transports + `ReachedByW3d2C`** — `reachedByW3d2_shadow`, `probeDerived_eq_sem_settled`, **`checkFnR_eq_sem_settled`**, `round2_key_reads_derived`, **`writeLeg_sem_stable2`**, `reconcileJobsLR_emits`/`round1_emission_dirties`, `reconcileJobsLR_reach_collapse` | `GraphIndex/CascadeStrataSettle.lean` | W3d-2 item 3b (2026-07-12e): W3d2 chain structural mirrors + the shadow at every state (mid-round prefixes incl.); the settled-key derived read (factored from `graph_correct_w3d`); the stratum-staged bridge (routed guard = `sem` at settled+complete derived operand keys — attack-confirmed load-bearing); per-round settled/complete transports + the stratum fence (round 2 never targets stratum-1 keys); write-leg `sem` stability at BOTH strata (stratum-2 needs key AND operand keys unmapped — the attack-REFUTED "dirty ∨ settled" gains the third disjunct "operand-dirty"); every job EMITS (round-1 operand passes provably re-dirty stratum-2 readers); the two-round coverage chain (round-2 coverage rel. the MID state) |

**W3c is CLOSED (2026-07-11d).** Full detail: the 2026-07-11* PROOF_STATUS entries and the
ROADMAP W3c paragraphs. The pieces a W3d session will actually reuse:
- **Write model** (`ReconcileStars.lean`): `wildcardShapes` / `coveredFn` (star-subject
  `checkFn`) / `reconcileResidueKey` (wholesale stars+neg+upos recompute) / `reconcileKeyC`
  (covered-guarded edge fold) / `reconcileStarsKey` (residue-THEN-edges, the faithful atomic
  unit). Three structural devices: the **covered-filter collapse** (`reconcileKeyC_eq_filter` —
  the W3c edge fold IS a W3a `reconcileKey` on filtered candidates), the **shadow projection**
  (`reachedByW3c_shadow` — every W3c state has a W3a-admitted shadow with identical core), and
  **star-general operand-read inertness** (`graphRec_reconcileKey_inert`, no `StarFreeStore`).
  `reachedByW3c_master`: canonical base σ0 per chain — canonical `stars` rows + guard canonicity.
  T2a `reachedByW3c_inv` with ALL FOUR I6 clauses contentful.
- **Read half** (`ReconcileStarsComplete.lean`): `checkFn_eq_sem_w3c` (bridge on any W3c state);
  **the LINCHPIN `coveredFn_declared`** (no ghost star coverage: a `sem`-covered shape is
  DECLARED — first edge out of the `wAny` node is a materialised closure tuple whose star seed
  matched a wildcard-flagged restriction); `w3c_row_char` (persisted rows read at `sem` level);
  batch completeness for the WHOLESALE recompute (`reconcileJobsC_row_isSome`,
  `_neg_complete`/`_upos_complete` with the **∀-targeting-jobs enumeration form** — attack-
  confirmed necessary: a later same-key pass with an incomplete `negCands` drops the exclusion);
  `w3cComplete_derived_edge`; **`graph_correct_w3c`** (star ⇒ `stars`, bare ⇒ edge ∨ `stars`∖`neg`,
  userset ⇒ `upos` exactly — `hWSbare` kills userset coverage). Fragment hyps: `BareStarStore` +
  `TtuStarFree` + `hWSbare : ∀ sh ∈ wildcardShapes S, sh.2 = BARE` (decision-15) + the W3a/W3b
  carries (`hterm`/`hCO`/`hLU`/`hRootB`); query scope `hqs : name = STAR → predicate = BARE`,
  concrete object. T3/T6 `*_w3c` incl. `exclusion_effective_w3c` (a concrete subject excluded
  from UNDER a `T:*` grant — the space rule's `neg` actually excludes).

## The next task — W3d-2 endgame: the two-round targeted re-settlement → the invariant → `graph_correct_w3d2`

**W3d-2 item 3b is CLOSED (2026-07-12e — READ THE TOP PROOF_STATUS ENTRY).** The NEW
`GraphIndex/CascadeStrataSettle.lean` (sorry-free, axiom-clean, verify.sh green) has:
- **The W3d2 chain mirrors + shadow**: `runCascade2_cases`, endpoint closure,
  edge-target/source discipline, `reachedByW3d2_reach_collapse_root`,
  `reachedByW3d2_shadow` (mid-round prefix states shadowed too).
- **The stratum-staged read bridge**: `probeDerived_eq_sem_settled` (settled-key
  derived read, factored from `graph_correct_w3d`; pure per-key lemma) and
  **`checkFnR_eq_sem_settled`** (routed guard = `sem` at shadowed states whose
  derived operand keys are `SettledKey ∧ CompleteKey` + collapsed; per-def `hLU2`).
- **Transports**: per-round `settledKey/completeKey_jobsLR_untargeted` (routed
  other-key fixity); the stratum fence `round2_key_reads_derived` (round 2 never
  targets a stratum-1 key); write-leg `sem` stability at both strata
  (`writeLeg_sem_stable_sh` chain-agnostic stratum-1; **`writeLeg_sem_stable2`**
  needing key AND operand keys unmapped) + stratum-generic
  `settledKey/completeKey_writeLeg_sem`.
- **Groundwork**: `reconcileJobsLR_emits` → **`round1_emission_dirties`** (a round-1
  operand pass provably re-dirties its stratum-2 readers for round 2);
  `reconcileJobsLR_reach_collapse` (mid-batch); **`ReachedByW3d2C`** (per-round
  `W3dJobCoverage`; round-2 coverage rel. the MID state) + projection.
- **Attack findings (12e, recorded in PROOF_STATUS)**: "dirty ∨ settled" REFUTED at
  post-write states — the invariant is **settled ∨ dirty ∨ SOME-DERIVED-OPERAND-KEY
  dirty**; the bridge's settledness hypothesis is load-bearing.

**Next increments, in order:**
1. **The two-round targeted re-settlement** (mirror `settledComplete_cascade_targeted`
   over `reconcileJobsLR σ (jobs1 ++ jobs2)` via `reconcileJobsLR_append`): split at
   the LAST job targeting the key (`exists_last_targeting`); THE CASE ANALYSIS IS
   WORKED OUT in the 12e PROOF_STATUS design note — stratum-1 keys via per-job
   conservativity (`reconcileStarsKeyDR_eq` collapses routed passes to W3d-1 ones) +
   the shadow bridge (`checkFn_eq_sem_w3d` at mid-batch shadowed states); stratum-2
   keys in two shapes (Shape 1: operands clean ⇒ last targeting job in round 1,
   coverage baseline σ; Shape 2: some operand targeted in round 1 ⇒
   `round1_emission_dirties` + `hcover2` force the last targeting job into round 2,
   coverage baseline MID — stale round-1 edges are mid-state edge holders, hence in
   the last job's cands). Needs a routed mirror of `reconcileJobsD_key_edge_sem`
   (batch edge origin with the per-pass bridge; operand settledness threaded through
   prefixes by the untargeted transports + the stratum fence).
2. **`reachedByW3d2C_settled`** — the three-disjunct invariant by chain induction:
   empty (mirror `sem_nil_derived_false`, stratum-2 via the bridge over trivially
   settled stratum-1 keys); write legs (stratum-1 `settledKey_writeLeg_sem` ∘
   `writeLeg_sem_stable_sh`; stratum-2 ∘ `writeLeg_sem_stable2`, case-split on the
   three disjuncts + `cascadeKeys_writeLeg_mono`); cascade legs (accepted ⇒ quiescent
   by `cascade2_drains` ⇒ every key settled via increment 1 / transports).
3. **`graph_correct_w3d2`** (fully-drained `check = sem` over `ReachedByW3d2C`,
   W3d-1 subject/query scope) — untainted branch via shadow + `graphRec_base_eq_bs`;
   derived branch via `probeDerived_eq_sem_settled` at the (now settled) key, with
   the linchpin `coveredFn_declared` at the shadow. T3/T6 `*_w3d2` corollaries.
4. **The E-chain tail (item 5)**: extend `enumJobs` with the residue-named
   candidates (12c finding (c): `_derived_leaf_neg_ids`, `processor.py:461-495`, old
   `upos` ids `:425-429`) and discharge the two-round coverage/validity/scope
   hypotheses from the state.

Fragment carries: everything W3d-1 carried (`hterm`/`hCO`/`hRootB`/`hWSbare` +
`BareStarStore`/`TtuStarFree` + W2 carries; add-only STORE, decision 6) EXCEPT `hLU`
relaxed to `hLU2`. House rules: attack-first any NEW statement shape (the invariant
disjunction itself was already attack-shaped in 12e; the re-settlement lemma's shape
should be sanity-`#eval`ed if it deviates from the design note); subagents only for
read-only exploration.

**After W3d-2 → W4** (full-scope restatement — combine W1+W2+W3 generality, name the
closure `ReachedBy`, restate at `GraphAccepts` scope), then **Phase 6** (graph-model
conformance extension, CORRESPONDENCE.md, final review doc).

---

## After W3d (the remaining road)
- **W4 — full-scope restatement.** Combine W1+W2+W3 generality; name the closure
  `ReachedBy`; restate `graph_correct` / `graph_reached_inv` / `backend_equivalence` /
  T6a/T6b over it at `GraphAccepts` scope (discharges the deleted-as-false abstract
  obligations). Carry: `NodupKeys`, `RewriteRanked`, `TtuTuplesetsDirect`, `hterm`
  (re-examine which W3a terminality conditions W4 must relax — `PDerivedTTU`/
  `PDerivedUserset` shapes were deferred).
- **Phase 6 — hardening.** (a) graph-model conformance extension: drive the Lean
  `writeDirect`/`check` model against the PYTHON graph index over the fragment corpora
  (zcli already exists for `sem`; add a graph-state mode); (b) `CORRESPONDENCE.md`
  (Lean def ↔ Python file:line map); (c) final review doc using plan §7 wording
  verbatim.

Historical detail for every closed stage: `PROOF_STATUS.md` (ledger, newest first)
and `ROADMAP.md` (designs + post-mortems).
