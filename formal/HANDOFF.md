# HANDOFF.md — START HERE (the formal-verification entry point)

**A fresh session reads THIS FILE FIRST, top to bottom (~250 lines), then goes straight
to work on "The next task" below.** Pull in other docs only on demand:

| doc | what it's for | when to read |
|---|---|---|
| `PROOF_STATUS.md` | append-only session ledger (newest first) | the TOP entry only, for fine detail on the resume point |
| `ROADMAP.md` | per-stage designs + historical plans | the section for the stage you're working |
| `SEMANTICS.md` | the Phase-0 spec (`sem`, models, theorem statements) | when touching spec-level defs |
| `docs/formal-verification-plan.md` | original strategy/phases/honesty clauses | rarely; §7 for claim wording |
| `REVIEW.md` | historical one-shot session digest (2026-07-09→10) | never (history) |

**End goal:** a machine-checked proof that the set engine and graph index both compute
the stratified-Datalog¬ perfect model `sem` — hence are equivalent — with the Python
implementations pinned to the Lean models by the conformance harness. The honest claim
never rounds up to "the code is formally verified" (plan §7).

---

## House rules (non-negotiable, user-adjudicated)

1. **Honesty norm.** Never fake a proof, never postulate the thing being proven
   (no `check := sem` models, no invariant-as-postcondition). A documented `sorry`
   plus genuine infrastructure beats a fragile/unfaithful close. Never edit a
   golden/oracle/snapshot to make something pass.
2. **Attack first.** Before proving any NEW theorem statement, try to REFUTE it —
   concrete scenarios via `#eval` against the real `check`/`sem` (delete the scratch
   after recording the finding). This has killed five false statements so far
   (additive fuelBound, abstract WriteStep closure, T0a-sans-StoreDeclared, naive-W2
   TTU fragment, W3a single-edge collapse sans NoRuleOutputs). A session that kills a
   false statement is a GOOD session; record the finding.
3. **Green gate.** Every increment must keep `bash formal/verify.sh` green: lake build
   + **0 sorries** + zcli + axiom audit (only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`)
   + 60 Python conformance tests. Add new key theorems to `lean/ZanzibarProofs/Audit.lean`.
4. **Rhythm.** Commit each green increment with a `formal: <stage> — <what>` message;
   push at session end. Before ending: update this file's "The next task" + add a
   PROOF_STATUS.md session entry (top) + tick the ROADMAP stage marker.
5. **Faithfulness.** Model hypotheses must be faithful to the Python (cite file:line
   or the spec §). New fragment conditions need a comment saying what Python mechanism
   they mirror. Where a spec and the code disagree on a name, the code wins.
6. **Subagents** don't parallelize proof-closing (compiler-in-loop, deep coupling);
   use them only for read-only exploration/design.

## Build & verify

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.elan/bin:$PATH"                    # Lean v4.31.0, Mathlib pinned
cd formal/lean && lake build                            # library (incremental ~1 min)
lake build ZanzibarProofs.GraphIndex.ReconcileCorrect   # one module (~20 s)
bash formal/verify.sh                                   # THE gate (from repo root; ~5 min)
```

Python side runs under the repo conda env
(`C:/Users/avery/anaconda3/envs/graph-reachability-zanzibar-index/python.exe`).

**Lean/Mathlib gotchas (hard-won):** unfold plain defs with `unfold f` / `simp only [f]`,
not `rw [f]`. `omega` treats `∑`-atoms as opaque — good for combining sum `have`s.
`Finset.Ico` ← `Mathlib.Order.Interval.Finset.Nat`; big-operator ring lemmas ←
`Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Ring.Finset`; `ring` ← `Mathlib.Tactic.Ring`.
`NReaches` is head-oriented: back-append is `NReaches.tail`; back-REPLACE needs
last-edge surgery (`nreaches_last`, cf. `nreaches_relation_rewrite`).

**Staged T2 widening: W1 ✅ → W2 ✅ → W3a ✅ → W3b ✅ → W3c ✅ → W3d-1a ✅ → W3d-1b (fan-out completeness) NEXT → W3d-1c → W3d-2 → W4.**

**W3c is CLOSED (2026-07-11d).** Full detail: the 2026-07-11* PROOF_STATUS entries and the
ROADMAP W3c paragraphs. The pieces a W3d session will actually reuse:
- **Write model** (`ReconcileStars.lean`): `wildcardShapes` / `coveredFn` (star-subject
  `checkFn`) / `reconcileResidueKey` (wholesale stars+neg+upos recompute) / `reconcileKeyC`
  (covered-guarded edge fold) / `reconcileStarsKey` (residue-THEN-edges, the faithful atomic
  unit). Three structural devices: the **covered-filter collapse** (`reconcileKeyC_eq_filter` —
  the W3c edge fold IS a W3a `reconcileKey` on filtered candidates), the **shadow projection**
  (`reachedByW3c_shadow` — every W3c state has a W3a-admitted shadow with identical core), and
  **star-general operand-read inertness** (`graphRec_reconcileKey_inert`, no `StarFreeStore`).
  `reachedByW3c_master`: canonical base σ0 per chain — canonical `stars` rows + guard canonicity.
  T2a `reachedByW3c_inv` with ALL FOUR I6 clauses contentful.
- **Read half** (`ReconcileStarsComplete.lean`): `checkFn_eq_sem_w3c` (bridge on any W3c state);
  **the LINCHPIN `coveredFn_declared`** (no ghost star coverage: a `sem`-covered shape is
  DECLARED — first edge out of the `wAny` node is a materialised closure tuple whose star seed
  matched a wildcard-flagged restriction); `w3c_row_char` (persisted rows read at `sem` level);
  batch completeness for the WHOLESALE recompute (`reconcileJobsC_row_isSome`,
  `_neg_complete`/`_upos_complete` with the **∀-targeting-jobs enumeration form** — attack-
  confirmed necessary: a later same-key pass with an incomplete `negCands` drops the exclusion);
  `w3cComplete_derived_edge`; **`graph_correct_w3c`** (star ⇒ `stars`, bare ⇒ edge ∨ `stars`∖`neg`,
  userset ⇒ `upos` exactly — `hWSbare` kills userset coverage). Fragment hyps: `BareStarStore` +
  `TtuStarFree` + `hWSbare : ∀ sh ∈ wildcardShapes S, sh.2 = BARE` (decision-15) + the W3a/W3b
  carries (`hterm`/`hCO`/`hLU`/`hRootB`); query scope `hqs : name = STAR → predicate = BARE`,
  concrete object. T3/T6 `*_w3c` incl. `exclusion_effective_w3c` (a concrete subject excluded
  from UNDER a `T:*` grant — the space rule's `neg` actually excludes).

## The next task — W3d-1b: fan-out completeness (the cross-key hazard as a THEOREM)

W3d-1a (CLOSED 2026-07-11e, `GraphIndex/Cascade.lean`) put the scheduler in the model:
`writeLoggedRules` (one outbox row per accepted routed edge), `affectedKeys` (row → derived
keys whose operand cones read it), `runCascade` (reconcile mapped keys; Python's leftover
raise = a reject branch, **provably dead** at one stratum — `runCascade_no_abort`;
`cascade_drains` = earned `Quiescent`), and the INTERLEAVED closure `ReachedByW3d` (write
legs `FoldAdmits`; cascade legs job-valid + two-sided key coverage `hcover`/`hscope`).
Full detail: PROOF_STATUS 2026-07-11e; design + decisions 1–6: ROADMAP "W3d".

**W3d-1b closes the read gap: `check = sem` at every CASCADED W3d state.** The attack
scratch showed exactly why only cascaded states qualify: a post-cascade write leaves an
EXISTING derived key stale until the next cascade re-reconciles it (`check ≠ sem`
mid-transaction — faithful, Python cascades inside every write txn). The missing theorem
is **fan-out completeness**: a logged write whose new edges change some derived key's
`sem` (or its canonical residue guards) maps that key into `cascadeKeys` — a `sem` flip
needs a changed operand `graphRec`, hence a new reachability pair into an operand node,
whose head lies in some routed row's reach cone. Its contrapositive is the induction fuel:
**settledness** — "at every cascaded state, every derived key's rows/edges equal what a
fresh full-object reconcile at the CURRENT store would produce" — carried through write
legs (untouched cones ⇒ unchanged `sem` ⇒ still settled; touched keys become
frontier-mapped) and cascade legs (mapped keys re-settle via the W3c per-pass machinery;
`EvalEq` transfers it — `reconcileJobsL_evalEq`). NB the W3c master/`Inv` do NOT transfer
pointwise (chain shapes differ: base-then-passes vs interleaved) — settledness is the W3d
replacement, and `graph_correct_w3d` should fall out of settledness + `graph_correct_w3c`'s
per-key argument (or a W3cComplete-style batch reconstruction per cascaded state).

Concretely next session: (1) attack-first the fan-out completeness statement — hunt a
write that changes a derived `sem` while `affectedKeys` misses the key (candidates: ghost
subjects appearing only via new NODES not edges; star grants changing `coveredFn` through
probe 2/4 paths whose head node differs from the routed edge's object node; userset flows
threading MULTIPLE hops). (2) If it survives, formalize "sem stability off the mapped
keys" (the contrapositive), then the settledness invariant over `ReachedByW3d`, then
candidate-list coverage (W3d-1c models the audit enumeration `_leaf_concretes`,
`processor.py:394-441`, replacing the job-supplied cands — see ROADMAP). Fragment carries:
`hterm`/`hCO`/`hLU`/`hRootB`/`hWSbare` + `BareStarStore`/`TtuStarFree` + W2 carries;
add-only (removes stay out of scope, ROADMAP decision 6).

House rule 6 applies: subagents only for read-only exploration.

## After W3d (the remaining road)
- **W4 — full-scope restatement.** Combine W1+W2+W3 generality; name the closure
  `ReachedBy`; restate `graph_correct` / `graph_reached_inv` / `backend_equivalence` /
  T6a/T6b over it at `GraphAccepts` scope (discharges the deleted-as-false abstract
  obligations). Carry: `NodupKeys`, `RewriteRanked`, `TtuTuplesetsDirect`, `hterm`
  (re-examine which W3a terminality conditions W4 must relax — `PDerivedTTU`/
  `PDerivedUserset` shapes were deferred).
- **Phase 6 — hardening.** (a) graph-model conformance extension: drive the Lean
  `writeDirect`/`check` model against the PYTHON graph index over the fragment corpora
  (zcli already exists for `sem`; add a graph-state mode); (b) `CORRESPONDENCE.md`
  (Lean def ↔ Python file:line map); (c) final review doc using plan §7 wording
  verbatim.

Historical detail for every closed stage: `PROOF_STATUS.md` (ledger, newest first)
and `ROADMAP.md` (designs + post-mortems).
