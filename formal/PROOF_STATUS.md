# PROOF_STATUS.md — living status / ledger / adjudications

The session-persistent brain for the formal-verification build (plan §8.3). Update
this before ending ANY session. A fresh session should read, in order:
`docs/formal-verification-plan.md` → this file → `formal/SEMANTICS.md`.

---

## Overnight autonomous run (2026-07-09 → 07-10)

User granted full autonomy ("keep going til you're done, I'll review tomorrow in one
go"). Plan, in priority order, committing each GREEN increment and documenting every
decision here:
1. Harden the spec: randomized conformance fuzzing (sem vs oracle vs set engine over
   random tuple subsets + grids). Safe (pure Python); catches spec bugs like the
   fuelBound one. Any unresolved divergence → adjudication log, don't block.
2. Concrete set-engine `expand` model (remove `opaque SetEngineModel.check`) + prove
   T1 with the algebra lemmas. Main proof effort.
3. Attempt T0a pigeonhole (`semAux_fuel_stable_step`) and T0b Kahn lemmas.
4. Attempt T4: define `pathCount` concretely, prove the first-edge recurrence + the
   counting theorem.
5. Shrink the opaque surface: concrete graph state types (even if T2/T5 stay sorry).
6. Final documentation + review summary.
Discipline: never commit a broken build; if a proof stalls past reasonable effort,
leave a documented `sorry` and move on. Update this file continuously.

## Overnight run RESULT (2026-07-10, end of session)

Delivered, all green + pushed (see REVIEW.md for the digest):
- **Found + fixed a real spec bug** (`fuelBound` additive→multiplicative), confirmed
  empirically, locked with the `deep_grid` regression. This was the headline outcome.
- **Conformance: 15 schemas, 60 tests green** (handwritten + randomized), three
  evaluators (`sem` / oracle / real set engine) agree everywhere. Added adversarial
  boolean corners (taint-over-boolean, nested boolean, double exclusion).
- **Proved (axiom-clean):** full MemberSet algebra + membership/constructor lemmas;
  `restrictionMatches_type` / T6c (real, not placeholder); `sem_fuel_stable` (T0a)
  reduced to one pigeonhole lemma. Axiom audit shows no custom axioms.
- **Tooling:** `zcli` CLI, `verify.sh` green gate, `Audit.lean` axiom check.
- **Handled a Gemini review:** adopted the valid fuelBound catch + WellDef
  decomposition (corrected); rejected the `phat_def` axiom (C4 cleanliness).

Remaining = the irreducible hard core (9 sorries): T1 (needs concrete expand model),
T2a/b + T5 (need concrete graph state machine), T4 counting (needs concrete pathCount
+ combinatorics), T0a pigeonhole core, T0b Kahn. All honestly deferred — NONE faked.
These want fresh context + the statement-review feedback; each is multi-hour.

**Next session resume:** see `formal/ROADMAP.md` (per-sorry plan, with corrections to
a Gemini roadmap). Phase 3 T1: the boolean STAR cases are done (`containsStar_*`); the
remaining nut is the INTENSIONAL `containsShape` distribution for concrete/ghost
subjects under a WF invariant — attempted this session, `simp; tauto` did NOT close
it (goal too large), so it's documented in ROADMAP with the intended route (a
`containsShape` normal-form lemma + per-atom split) rather than left as a `sorry`.
Gemini corrections logged: its set-engine model used `MemberSet String` (unsound —
name collisions across types; use `String × String`); its T0a pigeonhole is invalid
(our `semAux` has no visited-set); its T4 `phat_def` axiom rejected (C4 gate).

## Session 2026-07-10 (T0a FOUND FALSE AS STATED — restated over `StoreDeclared`)

Attacking the last `sorry` (`semAux_fuel_stable_step`), the first move was to
stress-test the *statement* — and it is **FALSE over an arbitrary store**,
machine-checked in Lean (`Spec/Counterexample.lean`, axiom-clean, no
`native_decide`):

- **The hole:** `ttuLeaf` consults `rec` at the subject of every stored tupleset
  tuple with **no restriction check** (faithful to the oracle's `ttu_leaf`, which
  also has none). Taint/`depEdges` predict TTU consultations from the *declared*
  restriction types (`directTypes`). An admission-invalid tuple therefore creates
  a consultation edge invisible to stratification — and it can close a cycle
  through an `excl` subtrahend.
- **The counterexample** (2 keys, 3 tuples): `(A,p) := direct[user] but not
  ttu(q, ts)`, `(C,q) := ttu(p, ts)` — `(A,ts)`/`(C,ts)` UNDECLARED — plus store
  tuples `C:c ts A:o` and `A:o ts C:c` closing the loop `(A,p)@o → (C,q)@c →
  (A,p)@o`. `S` is stratifiable (`depEdges = []`); `semAux` **oscillates with
  period 4 forever**: the proved recurrence is `semAux (n+2) = !(semAux n)` at
  the query atom (`T0aCounter.oscillates`), refuting the old statement
  (`T0aCounter.fuel_stable_step_false`). Empirically confirmed by `#eval` first.
- **Resolution (documented precondition materialized, NOT a weakening):**
  `SEMANTICS.md` §8 already says stores hold *write-valid tuples*, and the real
  admission gate (`engine.py:_validate` (2), shared by both backends) rejects
  exactly such tuples ("matches no declared type restriction"). New
  `StoreDeclared S T` (`Spec/Confine.lean`) captures the needed clause — every
  stored tuple's `(object.type, relation)` is declared and its subject type is
  among the declared restriction types; it is *implied by* the gate, so every
  reachable store satisfies it. `semAux_fuel_stable_step` / `sem_fuel_stable`
  now carry `hDecl : StoreDeclared S T`. The counterexample store violates it
  (`T0aCounter.not_storeDeclared`).
- **Conformance note:** the corpora are admission-valid, so `sem` = oracle stays
  green; the divergence (oracle's visited-set answers `true` stably, `sem`
  oscillates) exists only on stores the system cannot hold.
- Also fixed pre-existing breakage: `Audit.lean` still referenced
  `writeDirect_writeStep`/`reachedBy_of_direct` (deleted with the abstract
  layer); the stale `.olean` had masked it. The audit now rebuilds clean.

This is the third statement-level defect caught by attack-before-prove (after
the additive `fuelBound` and the abstract-closure falsehood). The `sorry` count
stays 1 — now a TRUE statement worth proving.

## Review handled 2026-07-10 (second Gemini review, post-restatement)

User shared a Gemini review after the restatement. Vetted against the repo;
outcomes (logged per the review-handling norm):
- **T4 section MOOT / stale-state error:** it presents an algebraic path "to
  close the `sorry`" in `pathCount_addEdge` and calls T4 a "main remaining
  hurdle" — T4 was closed 2026-07-09 (sorry-free, axiom-clean, in the audit).
  Its proposed expansion also uses ℕ-subtraction (`phat g a b - [a=b]`), the
  exact trap the real proof avoided via `rec_unique`. No action.
- **T0a lattice framing ADOPTED as a tactical note** (ROADMAP T0a section):
  monotone iteration on a finite Bool-lattice bounded by height, + one fuel
  step per Kahn rank. With the vetting caveat it glossed: `Rec` is not finite
  a priori — the confinement-to-reachable-atoms lemma remains the load-bearing
  prerequisite.
- Endorsements (operational-trace restatement, `fuelBound` multiplicativity,
  `instances`/`universe` ghost handling, W3 `upos ∩ neg = ∅` expected easy)
  are consistent with the repo; no changes needed.

## Session 2026-07-10 (abstract closure DELETED — T-theorems restated operationally)

User adjudication: **"if anything is incorrect then delete it and rewrite the
plan; the end goal is still a formally verified Zanzibar/OpenFGA model tied to
the Python implementation."** Executed the deletion + restatement; `verify.sh`
green (build + audit + 60 conformance).

**What was deleted (false or assertion-backed, per the same-day FINDING):**
- `WriteStep` / `ReachedBy` (State.lean) — the abstract postcondition closure;
  admitted junk states (nothing tied `σ.edges`/`σ.residue` to the store).
- `graph_correct`, `graph_reached_inv` (Correct.lean) — **false as stated**;
  these were the 2 tracked T2 sorries.
- `backend_equivalence`, `exclusion_effective`, `no_ghost_grant` (Equiv.lean) —
  also false as stated (same junk-state counter-model); they had been "proved"
  only by `rw` through the false `graph_correct`.
- `cascade_converges` (old form) — true only because `WriteStep` *asserted*
  drainedness; `writeDirect_writeStep`, `reachedBy_of_direct` (Write.lean).

**⚠ `sorry` count 3 → 1 BY DELETION, NOT PROOF.** The full-scope obligations are
not gone — they return as ROADMAP stage W4 (restatement over the completed
operational write model). This is recorded loudly to keep the count honest.

**What replaced it (all real, proved, axiom-clean, sorry-free):**
- `graph_reached_inv` (T2a) + `cascade_converges` (T5) restated over
  `ReachedByDirect` in Correct.lean (one-liners off `reachedByDirect_inv`;
  fragment scope: writes produce no deltas, so T5 is trivially drained until
  the reconcile model lands).
- T2b = `graph_correct_direct` (DirectCorrect.lean, unchanged from the morning
  session).
- `backend_equivalence` (T3), `exclusion_effective` (T6a, deny-propagation at
  this scope — the fragment has no exclusions; the exclusion content arrives at
  W3/W4), `no_ghost_grant` (T6b) restated over `ReachedByAdmitted` in
  Equiv.lean, proved via T1 ∘ T2b-fragment + new `stratifiable_pureDirect`.
- Audit updated: `backend_equivalence` moved OUT of the sorryAx section; only
  `sem_fuel_stable` (T0a) remains there.

**Plan rewritten (ROADMAP top):** the end-goal architecture (sem↔Python via the
conformance harness; T1 done; T2 via staged operational write model; T3/T6
corollaries that widen per stage) + the staged T2 plan **W1 bridges → W2 rule
routing → W3 reconcile → W4 full-scope restatement**, plus a Phase-6
**graph-model conformance extension** (drive the Lean `writeDirect`/`check`
against the Python graph index) so the graph side gets the same executable tie
to the implementation that `sem` already has.

## Session 2026-07-10 (T2b SEMANTIC CORE CLOSED — `graph_correct_direct` on the fragment)

User: "assess, update the plan, then start on the hardest thing." Two assessment
outcomes, then the proof work:

**Assessment finding 1 (recorded in ROADMAP): the two T2 sorries are FALSE as
stated, not merely unproven.** `WriteStep`'s three thin postconditions (schema
fixed, nodes monotone, outbox drained) never tie `σ.edges`/`σ.residue` to the
store, and neither does `Inv` — a junk state carrying one arbitrary acyclic edge
satisfies `ReachedBy σ S [t]` + `Inv` + all schema hypotheses while `check` ≠
`sem`. So no proof effort can close `graph_correct`/`graph_reached_inv(Inv)` as
written; the operational write model is mandatory *for truth*. They stay as
tracked sorries only as placeholders for the eventual restatement over the
operational closure. Do not attack them as written.

**Assessment finding 2:** `ReachedByDirect` prepends a *rejected* write's tuple to
the store (writeDirect no-ops but `T` grows) — unfaithful to the composed system,
where the raised rejection rolls back the store insert too. Hence
`ReachedByAdmitted` (every step passed `admitEdge`), the faithful closure, on
which the edge set is **complete** for the store, not just sound.

**Proof work delivered (all green + pushed, axiom-clean, `verify.sh` full gate
incl. 60 conformance; `sorry` count held at 3 — nothing faked, the new theorem is
an addition, not a placeholder discharge):**

- **`semAux_mono`** (`Spec/FuelStable.lean`): fuel monotonicity of the evaluator
  on exclusion-free schemas (`Schema.noExclAll`), lifted from `evalE_mono`.
  Dual-use: T2b soundness fuel plumbing + a T0a untainted-layer ingredient.
- **New `GraphIndex/DirectCorrect.lean`** (~550 lines, sorry-free):
  - Fragment predicates `PureDirect` / `StoreValid` (the Python admission gate) /
    `StarFreeStore`, with `isDerived_pureDirect` (pure-direct ⇒ untainted ⇒ the
    read routes to `probeNonDerived`), `lookup_rel_ne_bare` (declared relation ≠
    `BARE`, via `WF.relNames` — `"..."` contains `'.'`), `lookup_keys_nonempty`.
  - `ReachedByAdmitted` + embedding into `ReachedByDirect`,
    **`admitted_edge_complete`** (every stored tuple's edge present), and
    `admitted_nodes_length` (`nodes = 2·|T|`, the fuel-bound arithmetic).
  - Star-free node algebra: `subjNode_plain`/`objNode_plain`, injectivity, and
    **`objNode_eq_subjNode`** — the flow-through identity that makes chain hops
    compose with `memberOfGranted`'s recursion.
  - `TupleChainN` (length-indexed chains) + `chainN_of_trail`.
  - The `directLeaf`/`memberOfGranted` interface: `grantsOf` pack/unpack,
    `directLeaf_grant_self`, `directLeaf_of_mog`, `mog_intro`, and the star-free
    eliminations `mog_elim`/`directLeaf_elim` (the `instances` branch cannot fire).
  - **`semAux_lift` — the semantic heart.** Membership propagates through a
    userset (`s ∈ s'` at fuel `f₀`, `s' ∈ v` at fuel `f` ⇒ `s ∈ v` at `f + f₀`):
    every direct match of `s'` at a grant is absorbed by `s`'s flow-through on the
    *same* grant (+ fuel monotonicity); every flow-through lifts by the fuel IH.
  - **`semAux_of_chainN`** (soundness): a length-`n` chain is a `sem` membership
    at fuel exactly `n` (base hop = self-grant at fuel 1; each hop lifts, f₀ = 1).
  - **`nreaches_of_semAux`** (completeness): fuel induction; direct match ⇒ the
    grant's own edge (edge-completeness), flow-through ⇒ IH + `.tail`.
  - **`graph_correct_direct`** — `check σ q = sem S T q` on the fragment,
    end-to-end: wildcard probes 2–4 die on star-free data (`nreaches_source/
    target_plain`), probe 1 bridges `reach ↔ NReaches ↔ compressed trail ↔
    TupleChainN ↔ sem`, chain fuel fits `fuelBound` (`2|T|+1 < |keys|·(2|T|+4)`).
  - Audit: `graph_correct_direct` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

**This discharges the ROADMAP-isolated "T2b semantic core" (chain =
`memberOfGranted` recursion, both directions) on the honest fragment.** What
remains for T2: wildcard bridges (model + read, the `wAny`/`wAll` promotion only
covers the first hop), TTU/computed/union defs (rule-routed materialization),
the derived/residue path + faithful reconcile (T2a), then the restated full T2b.

## Session 2026-07-10 (T2b groundwork — read=sem base case + soundness scaffold)

User: "keep going with the proof part T2; commit and push when ready." Scope
continues the deliberate honest DEFER: no full T2b close (the `TupleChain ↔ sem`
core is multi-session), but **four green+pushed axiom-clean increments building the
read=`sem` correspondence from both ends.** `sorry` count held at 3; `verify.sh`
green throughout (build + 60 conformance + audit; audit now tracks all seven new
lemmas, no `sorryAx`).

**T2b base case CLOSED end-to-end (`GraphIndex/Correct.lean`):**
- `evalE_empty_store` / `semAux_empty_store` / **`sem_empty_store`** — `sem S [] q
  = false` (empty store grants nothing; `computed` recurses into a uniformly-`false`
  `rec`, by fuel induction).
- `probeNonDerived_empty` / `probeDerived_empty` / **`check_empty`** — the empty
  index reaches nothing and persists no residue, so `check (emptyState S) q = false`.
- **`graph_correct_empty`** : `check (emptyState S) q = sem S [] q`. This is exactly
  the `ReachedBy.empty` case of `graph_correct` — the genuine base of its eventual
  induction, no `sorry`.

**Read lifted into the relational world (`GraphIndex/State.lean`):**
- **`probeNonDerived_iff`** — on an endpoint-closed state the executable ≤4-probe
  read equals the disjunction of the four `NReaches` conditions (subject/object each
  literal or promoted to its wildcard node), via `reach_iff_nreaches`. Moves the read
  off the fixed-fuel probe `σ.reach` into fuel-free `NReaches`, where the semantic
  correspondence will be argued.

**Reachability→`sem` soundness scaffold (`GraphIndex/Write.lean`):**
- **`writeDirect_edges`** — an accepted write prepends exactly the one materialized
  edge `subjNode t.subject → objNode t.object t.relation`; a rejected write is the
  identity on edges.
- **`reachedByDirect_edge_sound`** — every edge of a `ReachedByDirect` state
  materializes some stored tuple (unconditional; induction over the write path).
- **`TupleChain`** + **`reachedByDirect_nreaches_chain`** — a graph path in the
  untainted fragment IS a stored-tuple membership chain (consecutive hops share the
  intermediate node = userset flow-through). Every `NReaches` path is a `TupleChain`.
  This is the soundness direction of T2b's reachability half, fully relational.

**The remaining T2b core, now sharply isolated:** the semantic content is
**`TupleChain T u v ↔ sem`-membership** — matching the membership chain against
`directLeaf`/`memberOfGranted`'s userset recursion, the wildcard nodes (`wAny`/`wAll`
promotion in `probeNonDerived_iff`), `instances`, and `matchingObjects`. Plus the
converse edge-completeness (`TupleChain → NReaches`) which needs an acyclic-*data*
hypothesis (`writeDirect` drops cycle-forming edges while `sem` fuel-evaluates them —
the T2b subtlety flagged last session). The read/reachability plumbing is now done
on both ends; what is left is the genuine `chain = recursion` semantic core. The
derived (residue) path of T2b and the full-generality `graph_reached_inv` `Inv`
conjunct (derived reconcile) remain the other deferred halves, unchanged.

## Session 2026-07-10 (T2a write model — untainted direct fragment)

User: "clear T2 as much as possible; commit often, push when done." Scope call
(user-adjudicated up front via a fidelity question): **build the concrete write
model, honest, no discharge expected this session.** Continues the deliberate
DEFER — the abstract `WriteStep` is now being *realized operationally* rather than
strengthened by postulate. Two green+pushed increments; `sorry` count held at 3;
all new results axiom-clean (audited).

**New file `GraphIndex/Write.lean` — the concrete single-tuple write for the
untainted (residue-free) fragment:**

- `writeDirect` — materialize one direct tuple as the edge `subjNode s → objNode o
  R`, **guarded by cycle-rejection** (§7.3: a self-loop or back-path-forming write
  is rejected and leaves the state unchanged; the back-path premise for
  `structInv_addEdge` comes from the executable admission probe via
  `reach_complete`). `admitEdge` is the decidable admission Bool.
- `nodeEnc_subjNode`/`nodeEnc_objNode` — endpoint nodes are always encoding-valid.
- `structInv_writeDirect` — structural invariant preserved by the write.
- `ResidueEmpty` + `residueEmpty_writeDirect` — the fragment (no persisted
  residues) is closed under writes; `inv_writeDirect` then preserves the **whole**
  `Inv` (residue clauses vacuous).
- `writeDirect_writeStep` — the concrete op realizes the abstract `WriteStep`
  (schema fixed, nodes monotone, quiescence preserved).
- `ReachedByDirect` (concrete write-closure) + `reachedByDirect_inv` — **T2a's
  `Inv` conjunct, honestly proved for the untainted fragment** (Inv ∧ ResidueEmpty
  ∧ Quiescent at every reached state, by induction over the write path).
  `reachedBy_of_direct` embeds it in the abstract `ReachedBy`.

**What this does NOT yet close, sharply isolated for the next pass:**
1. **Derived reconcile (rest of T2a).** `writeDirect` covers only untainted
   closure edges. The derived path (§7.6/§7.8) must (a) materialize residues via a
   faithful `reconcile`, and (b) handle the cross-key hazard the current fragment
   dodges by `ResidueEmpty`: an edge write can make an existing residue's `neg`/
   `upos` subject edge-reachable, breaking `negEdgeFree`/`uposEdgeFree` until the
   cascade re-reconciles. `inv_putResidue` (State.lean) is the per-key tool; the
   write must apply it to *all* reachability-affected keys with the correct
   residues.
2. **Read correspondence `check = sem` (T2b).** For the pure-direct fragment
   `check` reduces (no-wildcard) to `reach = NReaches`, and NReaches on the
   writeDirect-built edges *should* equal `directLeaf`'s transitive membership —
   BUT the subtlety is cycle-rejection: `writeDirect` silently drops cycle-forming
   edges, so on cyclic *data* the graph's edge set differs from "all tuples" while
   `sem` fuel-evaluates. The correspondence needs an acyclic-data hypothesis (or to
   account for rejected writes). Do NOT rush this — it is the genuine T2b core.

## Session 2026-07-10 (T2a groundwork — reachability layer fully proved)

User: "get the rest of T2 finished; commit often, push whenever you can." Scope
call (user-adjudicated mid-session via a fidelity question): **keep T2a honest,
DEFER** — do not postulate I6 as a `WriteStep` postcondition (the A1-style
operational shortcut was explicitly declined for `Inv`); instead **build toward the
genuine close** (the `reach ↔ NReaches` stabilization + a faithful reconcile). No
`sorry` discharged (count held at 3, as the user accepted); six green+pushed
increments of genuine, axiom-clean infrastructure delivered. `verify.sh` green
throughout (build + 60 conformance + audit).

**All in `GraphIndex/State.lean`, all axiom-clean (three standard axioms or fewer):**

- **Fuel-free reachability `NReaches`** (transitive closure of the edge list;
  distinct from WellDef's `Key`-typed `Reaches`). `Inv`'s reachability clauses
  (`acyclic`/`negEdgeFree`/`uposEdgeFree`) restated over it — this sidesteps the
  `nodes.length`-fuel churn that perturbs a capped probe when a write adds nodes.
  Lemmas: `NReaches.tail/trans/mono`, `NReachesR.trans`, `nreaches_nil`,
  `nreaches_cons_split` (first-use decomposition), **`acyclic_addEdge`**
  (cycle-rejection preserves acyclicity — the load-bearing I2 lemma).
- **Write-path primitives + preservation.** `addNode`/`addEdge`/`putResidue` with
  `@[simp]` projections; `StructInv` (the 4 structural clauses) + `structInv_addNode`
  / `structInv_addEdge` (genuine, cycle-rejection via `acyclic_addEdge`) /
  `structInv_empty` / `Inv.toStruct`; **`inv_putResidue`** (full `Inv` preserved by
  writing one I6-hygienic residue — other keys untouched; depends on *no* axioms).
- **`reach ↔ NReaches` BRIDGE — the ROADMAP-flagged "T2b blocker", now CLOSED.**
  `reachB_sound` + `reachB_mono` (soundness, any fuel); `reachB_of_nreaches` +
  `nreaches_iff_reachB` (unbounded equivalence); then the **shortest-walk
  compression** — `Trail` walk API (`trail_split`, `reachB_of_trail`,
  `trail_of_nreaches`, `trail_verts_mem`), pigeonhole plumbing (`mem_split_aux`,
  `exists_dup_split`, `nodup_len_le`), **`trail_compress`** (a walk with interiors
  in `nodes` shortens to ≤ `nodes.length` interiors), giving **`reach_complete`** and
  **`reach_iff_nreaches`**: the executable fixed-fuel probe `σ.reach` EXACTLY decides
  `NReaches` on any endpoint-closed state.

**What still blocks the two T2 sorries (unchanged in kind, now sharply isolated):**
the **faithful write/reconcile model** — how one tuple write produces the exact
edges + reconciled residues. Needed by BOTH: T2a (global I6 re-establishment after
edge changes — `inv_putResidue` handles one key; the write must cover all
reachability-affected keys with the *semantically correct* residues, so a
delete-only "reconcile-by-construction" is unfaithful and would break T2b) and T2b
(`check = sem` — the ≤4-probe decomposition now has its reachability half via the
bridge, but still needs the residue = `sem` half from the write model). This is the
genuine multi-session core; the reachability layer under it is now done.

## Session 2026-07-10 (T2 graph model CONCRETIZED — T5 closed)

**Scope decision (user-approved): "concretize + partial proofs," not the full T2
close** (T2 is the ~half-effort multi-session core; a faithful full close isn't
honestly doable in one pass, and a cooked `check := sem` model was explicitly
rejected). Delivered, `verify.sh` green (build + 60 conformance + audit),
count **4 → 3**:

- **All 7 opaque graph placeholders are now CONCRETE** (`GraphIndex/State.lean`,
  `sorry`-free): `GraphState` (nodes with `plain/wAny/wAll` variants, direct edges,
  residues `(stars,neg,upos)`, outbox+watermark), `GraphModel.check` (the faithful
  §7.5 ≤4-probe read + §7.6 residue path, routed by `isDerived`), `Inv` (I-series
  core: node encoding, I1 endpoint existence, I2 acyclicity, I6 residue hygiene incl.
  the load-bearing `neg ∩ edge-holders = ∅`), `ReachedBy` (inductive write-closure
  from `emptyState` via a minimal operational `WriteStep`), `Quiescent`
  (outbox-drain), `GraphAccepts` (decision-15 scope). The C4 "pending opaque" list
  for the graph model is cleared.
- **Reads model reachability, not path counts.** `check` probes a fuel-bounded
  transitive closure `reachB` of the direct edges (`p(u,v)>0`), factoring the
  path-*counting* layer out to `Closure.lean`/T4 — this dodges threading a
  `Fintype NodeKey` (infinite key space) through the read and keeps `check`
  executable. `Inv.acyclic` pins the DAG property T4 needs.
- **T5 `cascade_converges` CLOSED, axiom-clean** (`[propext]`). The model bakes the
  in-txn cascade into each write (§7.8 / A1, user-approved), so outbox-drain is a
  `WriteStep` postcondition and `Quiescent` holds at every reachable state by
  induction on `ReachedBy`.
- **T2a `graph_reached_inv`**: the `Quiescent` conjunct is closed (via
  `cascade_converges`); the `Inv` conjunct stays a tracked `sorry` (needs the full
  operational write path — edge/bridge/reconcile — which `WriteStep` abstracts).
- **Partial base-case lemmas, axiom-clean:** `inv_empty`, `quiescent_empty`,
  `reach_empty` (`reachB [] = false`).

**Remaining 3 sorries:** `semAux_fuel_stable_step` (T0a); `graph_reached_inv`'s `Inv`
half and `graph_correct` (T2b, the read = `sem` completeness argument) — the genuine
deep content, deferred as before. The concretization makes those statements relate
*real* definitions (not opaque constants), so the next attempt starts from a concrete
model rather than a stub.

## Session 2026-07-09 (T1 FULLY CLOSED — set engine = sem)

**T1 is DONE** — `setEngine_correct` is proved and axiom-clean (`[propext,
Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, verified in `Audit.lean`). Count 5 → 4. `verify.sh`
green (build + 60 conformance + audit). The `opaque SetEngineModel.check` is replaced
by a concrete MemberSet-expand model. **T1 needs no WF/Stratifiable/AllValid** — the
hypotheses are retained (underscored) but unused: the expansion computes `semAux` at
*every* fuel, so equality at the shared `fuelBound` is unconditional.

**The model (`SetEngine/Eval.lean`).** `Id := SubjectRef`; `expandAux` is pure
fuel-recursion mirroring `semAux` (`expandStep`/`expandE` mirror `step`/`evalE`);
boolean nodes fold with `union`/`intersect`/`subtract`; leaves are `grantMS`/`parentMS`
(token `singletonEntity`/shape `star` + flow-through recursion), faithfully
transcribing `engine.py:direct_expand`/`ttu_expand`. `check` = `containsShape` of the
expanded query node at the query subject.

**The key modeling insight (makes the whole thing tractable).** `containsShape` *never
reads `pop`* — only `pos`/`stars`/`neg`. The distribution lemmas
(`containsShape_*_focus`) prove the probe answer is invariant across *any* population
satisfying `PopFocus`/`WFp`/`Grounded`. So I use a **query-focused population**
`popOf s σ = {s}` at `s`'s own shape, `∅` elsewhere — which makes all three invariants
hold *definitionally* (`popFocus_popOf`, `grounded_popOf` are trivial; `WFp` is every
`normalize` output). This discharges the "confinement" obligation the ROADMAP flagged
as the largest remaining piece, with **no** `pos ⊆ U` induction.

**Proof structure (`SetEngine/Correct.lean`, all axiom-clean).**
- `containsShape_unionFold` — probing a `union`-fold = `any` of the probes.
- `containsShape_grantMS` — one grant's probe = `grantMatch || grantFlow` (4-way on
  subject kind × wildness); `containsShape_expandDirect` assembles via `any_or_distrib`
  and a per-subject-kind match, `directLeaf`'s `memberOfGranted` = `any grantFlow` by
  `rfl`.
- `any_filter_guard` + `containsShape_expandTtu` — `ttuLeaf`'s guarded `T.any` =
  filtered `ttuParents.any`; per-parent probe matches by `pn == STAR` case split.
- `containsShape_expandE` (structural: boolean via `*_focus`, leaves via the above,
  `computed` = `HR`), `containsShape_expandAux` (fuel induction: `HR` = the fuel-IH,
  `HW` = `wfp_expandAux`), then `setEngine_correct`.
- Tactic notes for the leaf Bool-algebra: `beq_eq_decide` bridges `==`↔`decide`;
  `bool_eq_of_iff` + expanding `= true` lemmas + `SubjectRef.eq_iff` reduces to pure
  Props; `eq_comm` in *full* `simp_all` LOOPS with `decide`/`Bool` present (max-recursion)
  — keep it out; canonicalize orientation at Prop level or fall back to `tauto`/`aesop`.

**Now unblocked:** T3/T6a/T6b `rw`-route through T1∘T2b — they become real the moment
T2b lands. Remaining 4 sorries: T0a `semAux_fuel_stable_step`; T2a/T2b/T5 (need the
concrete graph state machine). Next-most-tractable: T0a (see ROADMAP option (a)).

## Session 2026-07-09 (T1 core corrected + T0a ingredient 1)

User asked to build T0a and T1. Both are multi-session (each needs its concrete
model/infrastructure first — see ROADMAP). This session delivered genuine, committed,
axiom-clean progress on both fronts; **no `sorry` discharged** (count held at 5), and
`verify.sh` stays green (build + 60 conformance + audit).

**Headline: the ROADMAP's T1 lemma was FALSE; corrected and proved.** The naive
intensional distribution `containsShape (op M N) = containsShape M ⟨op⟩ containsShape N`
under `WF` alone does NOT hold — `#eval`-confirmed counterexample with both operands
`WF`: `a={stars:={σ}}`, `b={stars:={shape}, neg:={uid}}`, `uid∈pop σ`, `σ≠shape` ⇒
both operands `false`, `union a b` `true`. This is exactly why last session's
`simp; tauto` never closed it. **Root cause:** the query shape must be the subject's
*own* shape and populations partition the id space by shape — the missing invariant
`PopFocus pop uid shape := ∀ σ, uid∈pop σ → σ=shape`. New file `SetEngine/Contains.lean`
(axiom-clean, `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`):
- `containsShape_union_focus` (needs `PopFocus` + `WFp`),
- `containsShape_intersect_focus` / `containsShape_subtract_focus` (additionally need
  `Grounded pop uid shape m := uid∈m.pos → uid∈pop shape` — else a positive *ghost* is
  dropped by the extensional meet/difference; also `#eval`-confirmed false without it),
- support: `WFp`, `wfp_normalize`/`wfp_union/intersect/subtract`, `PopFocus`,
  `Grounded`, `mem_starpop_focus`, `mem_ext_focus`, `containsShape_normalize`,
  `wfp_atoms`, `bool_ext`. Technique: reduce to 7 membership atoms, then
  `by_cases`-on-all-7 `<;> simp_all` (tauto times out).
**T1 next:** build the concrete `SetEngineModel.check` expand model whose `pop`/`Id`
*satisfy `PopFocus`+`WFp`+`Grounded` per node*, then the `Direct`/`TTU` leaf-vs-`sem`
equalities. The distribution core is now done.

**T0a: decision + ingredient 1.** Chose option (a) (real proof, no spec change).
New file `Spec/FuelStable.lean` (axiom-clean): `evalE_mono` — untainted/positive
fragment monotonicity (`RecLe`-refinement preserves truth on exclusion-free exprs),
via `memberOfGranted_mono`/`directLeaf_mono`/`ttuLeaf_mono` + `Expr.noExcl`. This is
step 1 of the convergence argument (untainted fragment = monotone iteration). The
full worked-out structure (untainted monotone layer + tainted Kahn-DAG ranks + the
reachable-atom counting bound) is in the file header and ROADMAP. Confirmed: pure
pigeonhole is invalid (no visited-set; `Φ` non-monotone via `.excl`).

## Session 2026-07-09 (T0b fully closed — Kahn correctness)

**T0b is DONE** — `stratify_none_iff_cycle` and `stratify_topological` are proved and
axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`). All in `Spec/WellDef.lean`, built
from scratch on the concrete `kahn`/`readyNodes`/`depEdges` (no new model needed, as the
ROADMAP predicted). Count 7 → 5. `verify.sh` green (build + 60 conformance + audit).

Infrastructure proved (all axiom-clean, reusable):
- `mem_readyNodes_iff` — `n` ready ↔ remaining ∧ every out-edge leaves remaining.
- `kahn_succ` — one-step unfolding of `kahn` on a non-empty remaining set (isolates the
  definitional `if`/`let` churn once).
- `stuck_cycle` — **the pigeonhole core**: a non-empty stuck set (no ready nodes) has a
  cycle. Builds a total successor `g` (choice), iterates `g^[·]` into `R.toFinset`,
  `Finset.exists_ne_map_eq_of_card_lt_of_maps_to` gives a repeat, `reaches_orbit` turns
  the sub-walk into `Reaches edges k k`.
- `kahn_none_stuck` (⟹): `kahn = none` ⇒ a stuck set exists. The invariant
  `|remaining| ≤ fuel` (fuel starts at `|nodes|`, each round drops ≥1 via
  `List.length_filter_eq_length_iff`) rules out the fuel-exhaustion branch, so only a
  genuine stuck set can fail.
- `first_edge` / `cyc_out` — a cycle node has an out-edge to another cycle node.
- `kahn_cycle_none` (⟸): every cycle node persists in `remaining` (never ready), so the
  run never empties ⇒ `none`.
- `depEdges_mem` — both endpoints of a dependency edge are tainted keys (pins cycle
  nodes ⊆ initial `remaining`).
- `kahn_topo` — **the topological invariant**: threads (H1) `acc.reverse` is already
  topological + (H2) peeled nodes' out-edges have left `remaining`. Newly-peeled ready
  layer is appended last; readiness + H2 force its edges strictly earlier, so the
  invariant is preserved and the final `L` is `TopoLayered`. Needed hand-rolled
  `getD_app_lt`/`getD_app_ge`/`getD_ge_default`/`mem_getD_singleton` (this Mathlib has no
  `getD_append`).

**Next-most-tractable remaining:** T0a `semAux_fuel_stable_step` (subtle — see ROADMAP;
may want the visited-set spec refactor + conformance re-validation), then T1/T2 which need
their concrete models built first.

## Session 2026-07-09 (T4 fully closed)

**T4 is DONE** — `GraphIndex/Closure.lean` is `sorry`-free and axiom-clean. Built the
walk API the ROADMAP called the blocker, then the counting theorem, all from scratch on
the concrete `pathsOfLength`:
- `pathsOfLength_pos_iff` — walk-count positivity ↔ an `IsChain` vertex list (bridges to
  Mathlib's `List.IsChain` reachability API).
- `pathsOfLength_card_vanish` — **the pigeonhole vanishing lemma**: an acyclic graph has
  no length-`|V|` walk (`|V|+1` vertices ⇒ repeat ⇒ closed sub-walk via `IsChain.drop/take`
  + `getElem?_drop`/`getElem?_take_of_succ` ⇒ `pathCount x x > 0` ⇒ ⊥). Discharges the
  `hvanish` hypothesis of `phat_recurrence`.
- `pathsOfLength_succ_last` (last-edge decomposition), `pathsOfLength_mono`,
  `acyclic_of_addEdge`, `no_back_path` (the new edge can't close a cycle — needs L2).
- `rec_closed_form` / `rec_unique` — the affine recurrence `X a = c a + ∑ dcount·X`
  has a **unique** solution in a DAG (unroll `|V|` steps; the `X`-tail vanishes, leaving a
  matrix series in `c` only). No Nat subtraction anywhere.
- `pathCount_addEdge` — `phat g'` and the target formula both solve `g'`'s recurrence, so
  by `rec_unique` they coincide; the spurious back-path term vanishes by `no_back_path`.
- `pathCount_removeEdge` — the exact inverse: `(g.removeEdge u v).addEdge u v = g`, so it
  is `pathCount_addEdge` applied to `g.removeEdge u v`.

Count 9 → 7. `verify.sh` green (build + 60 conformance + audit). **Next-most-tractable
remaining: T0b Kahn** (self-contained, no new model needed); then T1/T2 need their
concrete models built first (see ROADMAP).

## Current phase & resume point

- **Phase 1 DONE** (Lean skeleton + all T0–T6 stated; `lake build` green with 9
  `sorry`s). **Phase 2 CORE DONE ahead of schedule**: conformance CLI (`zcli`) live;
  spec-vs-oracle answer conformance green (6/6 grid comparisons). No adjudication
  events — the executable `sem` matches the reference oracle.
- **User is reviewing `SEMANTICS.md` async** ("keep going, I'll review async"); A1 &
  A4 accepted. Continue proving; revisit if the review changes the spec.
- **Resume point → Phase 3:** replace the `opaque SetEngineModel.check`
  (`SetEngine/Eval.lean`) with a concrete MemberSet-expand model, prove T1
  (`setEngine_correct`), and extend conformance to compare the set-engine MODEL.
- **Commands:** `cd formal/lean && lake build` (lib) / `lake build zcli` (CLI);
  `python -m pytest formal/conformance/ -q` (needs `zcli` built).

## `sorry` ledger

**Count = 1** (was 9). Location:
- `Spec/WellDef.lean`: `semAux_fuel_stable_step` (feeds `sem_fuel_stable`) (1)

**⚠ HONESTY NOTE on the 3 → 1 drop (2026-07-10):** the two `GraphIndex/Correct.
lean` sorries (`graph_correct`, `graph_reached_inv`'s `Inv` conjunct) were
**DELETED as false-as-stated, not proved** (user-directed; the abstract
`WriteStep`/`ReachedBy` closure admitted junk states). Their obligations return
at full scope as ROADMAP stage W4. The theorem names survive, restated over the
operational closure at fragment scope, where they are genuinely proved
(`graph_reached_inv`/`cascade_converges` over `ReachedByDirect`;
`graph_correct_direct`/T3/T6a/T6b over `ReachedByAdmitted`).

**`GraphIndex/DirectCorrect.lean` is `sorry`-free** — the T2b semantic core
(userset lifting, chain ⇔ `sem`, both directions) and the end-to-end fragment
read-correctness theorem `graph_correct_direct`.

**`GraphIndex/State.lean` is `sorry`-free** — the 7 opaque graph placeholders are now
concrete definitions; `cascade_converges` (T5) is closed off the concrete `ReachedBy`.

**`GraphIndex/Write.lean` is `sorry`-free** — the concrete write model for the untainted
fragment (`writeDirect` + preservation + `ReachedByDirect`/`reachedByDirect_inv`); T2a's
`Inv` conjunct is proved honestly for the residue-free fragment. The abstract
`graph_reached_inv` sorry remains (its generality covers derived relations, which need
the reconcile/residue-materialization half — the isolated remaining T2a content). Now
also carries the reachability→`sem` soundness scaffold (`writeDirect_edges`,
`reachedByDirect_edge_sound`, `TupleChain`, `reachedByDirect_nreaches_chain`).

**`GraphIndex/Correct.lean`'s T2b base case is `sorry`-free** — `graph_correct_empty`
(`= sem S [] q`, both `false`) discharges the `ReachedBy.empty` case end-to-end. The
two full-generality `sorry`s (`graph_reached_inv`'s `Inv` conjunct, `graph_correct`)
remain; the T2b core left is `TupleChain ↔ sem`-membership (see the session entry).

**`SetEngine/Correct.lean` is now `sorry`-free** — `setEngine_correct` (T1) proved and
axiom-clean; the `opaque SetEngineModel.check` is replaced by a concrete expand model.

**`Spec/WellDef.lean`'s T0b theorems are now `sorry`-free** — `stratify_none_iff_cycle`
and `stratify_topological` proved and axiom-clean.

**`GraphIndex/Closure.lean` is now `sorry`-free** — `pathCount_addEdge` /
`pathCount_removeEdge` proved and axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).

## Axiom audit snapshot (C4) — `lake build ZanzibarProofs.Audit`

Run 2026-07-09. `#print axioms` on representative results:
- `ext_normalize`, `ext_union`, `containsStar_subtract`, `mem_ext_union` →
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (the 3 standard axioms — clean).
- `restrictionMatches_type`, `wildcard_scoping`, `evalE_mono` → `[propext,
  Quot.sound]` (cleaner).
- `containsShape_union/intersect/subtract_focus` (T1 corrected core) → the 3 standard
  axioms.
- `sem_fuel_stable`, `backend_equivalence` → `[sorryAx]` (honestly flagged;
  route through tracked sorries). **No custom axioms** — Gemini's suggested
  `phat_def` axiom was rejected, keeping the surface clean for the final C4 gate.

## T4 progress (2026-07-10, this session)

`GraphIndex/Closure.lean`: `pathCount` **concretized** (weighted-walk sum over
`Fintype V`; the `opaque` is gone). Proved (axiom-clean): `pathsOfLength_zero/succ`,
`sum_Ico_shift_boundary` (Nat induction), `phat_boundary` (the first-edge recurrence
WITH the length-`|V|` boundary term, pure `Finset.sum` manipulation, no acyclicity),
and `phat_recurrence` (the clean recurrence, taking the DAG no-`|V|`-walk property as
an explicit hypothesis). Remaining T4 obligations (still `sorry`, count held at 9):
`pathCount_addEdge`/`removeEdge` — the algebraic expansion — plus discharging the
`hvanish` hypothesis via the pigeonhole vanishing lemma (needs a walk API; see
ROADMAP). Net: the mathematical heart of the counting theorem is proved; the
opaque is removed; count unchanged.

## Pending axioms (opaque placeholders — to be replaced, flagged by the C4 axiom audit)

The only remaining `opaque` is `ValidIdent` (Core/Ident — intended to stay abstract
per §2.1). **The entire graph model is now CONCRETE** — `GraphState`,
`GraphModel.check`, `Inv`, `ReachedBy`, `Quiescent`, `GraphAccepts` became real
definitions 2026-07-10 (State.lean); `pathCount` and `SetEngineModel.check` were
concretized earlier. The final axiom audit must show only `propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound` — no opaque model constants remain to eliminate (only the tracked
`sorry`s in `graph_reached_inv`/`graph_correct`/`semAux_fuel_stable_step`).

## Adjudications (spec/oracle/backend disagreements)

Per plan §8.2: any disagreement → STOP, record here (schema, ops, query, each
system's answer, analysis). Do NOT edit oracle/goldens/Python semantics or weaken a
theorem to match.

- **2026-07-09 — `fuelBound` too small (spec bug, not a semantic ambiguity). RESOLVED.**
  Found via a Gemini review of the Lean spec; **confirmed empirically**: a schema
  with `n` computed relations chained per object and linked across an `m`-object
  parent chain by TTU (a `deep_grid`, n=m=8) evaluates at depth ~`n·m`=64, but the
  additive `fuelBound = |keys| + 2|T| + 4` = 29 cut `semAux` off early → spec
  returned `false` where the oracle returned `true`. The oracle is ground truth; the
  bug was mine (under-provisioned fuel). **Fix:** `fuelBound = |keys| · (2|T| + 4)`
  (multiplicative — the recursion depth is bounded by the `(entity × relation)` state
  space, not their sum). Added `deep_grid` to the conformance corpus as a permanent
  regression; conformance 33→36 green. The shallow original corpus is why it slipped
  past — lesson logged. No user adjudication needed (spec bug, clear resolution).

## Decisions & variations log

Variations from the plan (`docs/formal-verification-plan.md`) or from the repo's
own specs, with rationale. (The user asked that variations be documented.)

- **2026-07-09 — Phase 0 delivered as SEMANTICS.md + PROOF_STATUS.md + README.md**
  under `formal/`, matching plan §8.4 layout. No deviation.
- **2026-07-09 — Executable spec will use per-stratum fixpoint iteration, NOT the
  oracle's Tarjan-lowlink provisional-False control flow** (SEMANTICS.md §11-A2).
  Rationale: cleaner T0a/termination proof; agreement with the oracle asserted by
  conformance C1 rather than by matching control flow. The oracle is being demoted
  from ground truth to cross-check, so this is sound.
- **2026-07-09 — Non-stratifiable schemas are OUT of the verified envelope**
  (SEMANTICS.md §4.4). All theorems carry `stratify S = some strata`. This matches
  the security audit's recommendation to reject cyclic-through-boolean upstream.
- **2026-07-09 — User approved: "lgtm, write everything." A1 & A4 accepted as
  proposed.** Proceeding: Lean graph model bakes the cascade into write ops (A1);
  graph modeled at the connectedstore deduped-set boundary (A4).

### Phase 1 (Lean) decisions

- **Toolchain:** Lean `v4.31.0` (stable) + Mathlib pinned to tag `v4.31.0`, built
  against the prebuilt cache (`lake exe cache get`). `elan` installed to
  `~/.elan`. Project at `formal/lean/`, lib `ZanzibarProofs`.
- **`sem` is fuel-based and primitive-recursive on the fuel `Nat`** (§ Semantics.lean):
  `semAux (fuel+1)` = one immediate-consequence `step` applied to `semAux fuel`.
  `step` is parameterized by the sub-node answer function `rec`, so no
  termination entanglement; the boolean/leaf logic is all in `step`. Mirrors the
  oracle's depth-bounded provisional-False recursion. `sem` runs at `fuelBound`.
- **Binary `union`/`inter`** in the AST instead of n-ary (associativity + WF arity≥2
  make it faithful; no empty-fold fail-open). Logged in Schema.lean.
- **Backend models are `opaque` placeholders in Phase 1** (`SetEngineModel.check`,
  `GraphState`, `GraphModel.check`, `Inv`, `ReachedBy`, `Quiescent`,
  `GraphAccepts`). This keeps T1/T2/T5 non-vacuous (they relate an opaque model to
  `sem`, provable only once the model is concrete). Phases 3–4 replace the opaque
  declarations with real definitions. T3/T6a/T6b are ALREADY proved by `rw`
  through T1/T2b (so they become real the moment T1/T2b are discharged).
- **`stratify`/taint is an independent reimplementation** of `compute_taint` +
  `_stratify` (Kahn layering over derived-dependency edges). Fidelity to the Python
  is a Phase-2 conformance check, not assumed.
- **Reality check on "T0 is mechanical" (plan §9 P1):** it is NOT. `sem_fuel_stable`
  (T0a) rests on the stratified fixpoint being reached by `fuelBound` — a genuine
  theorem because exclusion is non-monotone in fuel. `stratify_*` (T0b) is Kahn
  correctness. Both are STATED (compiling) in Phase 1 with `sorry`; proofs are
  tracked and deferred rather than force-fit. `MemberSet.ext_normalize` IS proved.
- **T6c (`wildcard_scoping`)** is a trivial `rfl` placeholder to be refined to the
  precise scoping statement in Phase 5.

## Key facts a fresh session must not re-derive

- The spec `sem` = **stratified Datalog¬ perfect model, queried pointwise** — both
  backends compute it; equivalence is a corollary (`theory.md:192-198`).
- The oracle (`tests/oracle.py`) is the operational reference we are *replacing* with
  the Lean executable spec; it becomes a cross-check, not a proof target.
- **I9 (fixpoint audit) is test-suite-only**, not per-commit — so cascade-runs-in-txn
  is an assumed precondition (SEMANTICS.md §7.8, §11-A1). Most load-bearing fact.
- The counting theorem (T4) is sound **only because cycles are rejected** — the group
  `(ℤ,+)` inverse argument fails with cycles (`theory.md:57-61`). Rejecting cyclic
  schemas is a *necessity*, not a policy.
- Toolchain (elan/Lean/lake) is **not yet installed**; installing requires user
  permission (repo rule). Lean lives outside the conda env; conformance harness runs
  under the `graph-reachability-zanzibar-index` conda env.
- Python is READ-ONLY for this project except test-only conformance code under
  `formal/conformance/` (plan §8.3).
