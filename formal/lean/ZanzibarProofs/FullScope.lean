# W4 — the full-scope restatement (`ReachedBy`, `GraphAdmission`, the final T-theorems)

The W1→W3d-2 arc closed `check = sem` over the fully-operational two-round scheduler
chain (`ReachedByW3d2E`, `CascadeStrataAssemble.lean`). This file is the W4 assembly:

* **`ReachedBy`** — THE operational write-closure, by name. `:= ReachedByW3d2E`
  (logged writes + the state-derived two-round cascade). This is the model of the
  Python write path: `TupleSource` admission → `advance_index` → `DeltaProcessor.
  run_cascade` (`processor.py`, synchronous v1).
* **`GraphAdmission`** — the model-level admission bundle: hypotheses the Python
  compiler/write admission guarantees for EVERY accepted schema and store. Each
  field cites the enforcing mechanism.
* **`W4Fragment`** — the HONEST fragment carries: restrictions the current proof
  needs that Python admission does NOT imply. Each field names the gap (ROADMAP
  "W4 — honest gaps"). The final theorems take BOTH bundles; the claim is never
  rounded up to "everything the Python accepts" (plan §7).
* **`w4_within_scope`** — the bundles imply the spec's decision-15 scope predicate
  `GraphAccepts S` (`State.lean:625`, `SEMANTICS.md` §8): the proved fragment sits
  INSIDE the accepted class (the converse is false — acceptance admits more than
  the fragment; that surplus is exactly the honest-gaps list).
* The final **`graph_correct`** (T2b) / **`backend_equivalence`** (T3) /
  **`exclusion_effective`** (T6a) / **`no_ghost_grant`** (T6b) over `ReachedBy` —
  discharging the obligations whose abstract predecessors were deleted-as-false
  (2026-07-10). The W1 pure-direct versions keep their proofs under `*_direct`
  names in `Equiv.lean`.
* **Non-vacuity witnesses** (`W4Witness`): a concrete boolean schema + store
  satisfying both bundles, so the hypothesis set is machine-checked satisfiable —
  the attack of record for a restatement stage (a bundle nobody can inhabit would
  make every theorem below vacuously true).
* **`w4Fragment_of_untainted`** / **`drained_of_untainted`**: on an untainted
  schema every derived-scoped carry is vacuous and every chain state is drained —
  the W2 subsumption argument (ROADMAP W4 delta (2)) as theorems.

**T2a at this scope (`graph_reached_inv` over `ReachedBy`) is PROVED** — the full
8-clause `Inv` holds at every state of the two-round chain (`reachedByW3d2E_inv`,
`CascadeStrataEdge.lean`), and the final `graph_reached_inv` assembles here; closed
2026-07-12j (ROADMAP W4). The W1 pure-direct version keeps its proof as
`graph_reached_inv_direct`.

/-! ## The final operational closure -/

/-- **`ReachedBy` — the operational write-closure of the graph index, by name.**
    The fully-operational two-round scheduler chain: admitted logged writes
    (`writeLoggedRules`) interleaved with cascade legs that run the state-derived
    enumerated rounds (`runCascade2` over `enumJobs2R1`/`enumJobs2R2` — no
    chain-side hypotheses). Mirrors the Python synchronous write path
    (`connectedstore.advance_index` → `DeltaProcessor.run_cascade`). -/
abbrev ReachedBy : GraphState → Schema → Store → Prop := ReachedByW3d2E

/-- **Fully drained**: no dirty derived key above the watermark. The Python
    invariant at every commit boundary (synchronous v1 runs the cascade in the
    writing transaction; boolean spec §7.8). Read correctness holds exactly here —
    mid-drain states are honestly stale (the 12h attack). -/
abbrev Drained (S : Schema) (σ : GraphState) : Prop := cascadeKeys S σ = []

/-! ## The admission bundle and the fragment carries -/

/-- **`GraphAdmission S T` — the model-level admission bundle.** What the Python
    compiler + write admission guarantee for every schema/store they accept; the
    Lean mirror of "this schema compiled and these writes were admitted". Fields
    cite the enforcing mechanism:

    * `wf` — `"."` reserved in declared relation names (`parse_schema_ast`;
      `Core/Schema.lean` `relNameOK`).
    * `nodup` — the AST is dict-keyed: one def per `(type, relation)`.
    * `strat` — derived-dependency cycles raise `ValueError`
      (`compile_boolean_schema`; CLAUDE.md "derived-dependency cycles").
    * `ttuDirect` — `_validate_ttu_tuplesets` (`zanzibar_utils_v1.py:898-935`):
      an untainted TTU tupleset relation must be direct-only.
    * `matchDecl` — compiled `Rule`s route onto declared, untainted families
      (leaf routing splits derived storage onto leaf predicates; `RewriteFilter`
      targets are declared relations).
    * `ranked` — the untainted rewrite graph is acyclic/ranked (the compiler's
      rank assignment; `RulesSaturate.lean`).
    * `objWild` — object-wildcard shapes never target a derived relation
      (`_reject_object_wildcard_scope`, `zanzibar_utils_v1.py:1029-1034`).
    * `storeValid` — write admission: every stored tuple matches a declared
      `Direct` restriction of its `(object.type, relation)` def
      (`TupleSource`/`RuleSet.apply` filter admission). -/

  ranked : RewriteRanked S
  objWild : ∀ tr ∈ S.objectWildcards, isDerived S tr = false
  storeValid : StoreValidRules S T

/-- **`W4Fragment S T` — the honest fragment carries.** Scope restrictions the
    current proof needs that Python admission does NOT imply (each is a documented
    gap, ROADMAP "W4 — honest gaps at W4 close"):

    * `computedOnly` — derived defs read only computed operands (the compiled
      leaf-split form with `PClosureLeaf`-as-computed-leaf). Python also compiles
      `PDerivedTTU`/`PDerivedUserset` plan leaves — out of scope (W3a decision).
    * `twoStrata` — at most TWO derived strata dependency-wise (`hLU2`;
      attack-confirmed load-bearing: a 3-stratum schema fires the round-2 reject,
      `CascadeStrata.lean`). Python handles arbitrary strata.
    * `wsBare` — every declared wildcard restriction is bare (`[T:*]`). Python
      rejects wildcard USERSETS (`[T:*#p]`) only over derived relations
      (`zanzibar_utils_v1.py:1446-1451`); over untainted ones they are admitted
      (W1c covered their tuples on the pure-direct fragment only).
    * `bareStar` — stored star subjects are bare and objects concrete: no
      object-wildcard (`w_all`) tuples beyond W1b, no userset-star tuples beyond
      W1c, on this chain.
    * `ttuStarFree` — no stored star subject feeds a TTU tupleset.
    * `term` — derived relations are never TTU targets and never appear as stored
      userset-subject predicates (`NoTtuTarget`/`NoStoreSubjectR`, W3a
      terminality).

    The ADD-ONLY store restriction (decision 6) is a property of the chain — no
    remove legs in `ReachedBy` — not a hypothesis here. -/

    a derived relation — `wsBare` bans non-bare wildcard restrictions outright;
    (3) a TTU tupleset relation is never derived — a derived def is `ComputedOnly`
    (`computedOnly`), `ComputedOnly` exprs are not directs-only, and `ttuDirect`
    forces declared tupleset defs to be directs-only. The CONVERSE is false:
    `GraphAccepts` admits schemas outside `W4Fragment` (the honest-gaps list); this

    operational closure, the graph read computes the stratified-Datalog¬ perfect
    model — for derived AND untainted queries (the statement splits internally).
    Query scope: star subjects are bare (`hqs`), objects concrete (`hqo`).

/-- **T6a (`exclusion_effective`), full W4 scope.** Whenever the spec denies, BOTH
    backends deny — with real exclusion content at this scope: `sem` denies a
    subject removed by a `but not` operand, so neither backend can grant it
    (`exclusion_effective_w3c` exhibits the concrete under-a-star-grant case). -/

    keys and mid-drain states included, NOT only the drained ones. This discharges
    the T2a obligation whose abstract predecessor was deleted-as-false (2026-07-10,
    it quantified over a junk-admitting closure); the honest restatement is over
    `ReachedBy`, with the same provenance-split hypothesis bundle as

/-! ## The W2 subsumption — untainted schemas sit inside the full scope

ROADMAP W4 delta (2): on an `UntaintedSchema` every derived-scoped carry is
vacuous and every chain state is drained, so `graph_correct` needs only the three
contentful carries (`wsBare`/`bareStar`/`ttuStarFree`). The residual generality of
W2's `graph_correct_rulesBS` (no `hWSbare`/`hMatch`, plain-fold chain) is recorded
in the ROADMAP inventory, not re-proved here. -/

/-! ## A UNION-ROOTED derived witness (the exact scope Legs 1-2 widened)

`Sy`/`Ty` is the conformance corpus `taint_union_over_boolean` in compiled form:
a boolean `viewer := base ∖ blocked` over a bare-star base, then a
UNION-rooted derived def `approver := viewer ∪ admin`. Before the rootB widening
the fragment's `rootB` field rejected this (a union at the derived root); with
`RootBoolean` deleted (Leg 2) and the taint filter on `schemaRewrites` (Leg 1),
BOTH bundles are inhabited — so the widened `W4Fragment` non-vacuously admits a
union-rooted derived schema, and the final theorems have content there. The taint
filter is what makes `schemaRewrites Sy = []` (the `approver` union arms are
routed OFF the fanout because `approver` is derived), exactly as `compile_ruleset`
does — the mirror that closed the stale-fanout state divergence (2026-07-17). -/

/-! ## A DIRECT-ARM derived witness (the C-chain `graph_correct_w3d2_d` scope)

`Sd`/`Td` is the conformance corpus `direct_arm_exclusion` in compiled form:
`approver := [user] but not banned` — a derived def whose exclusion BASE is a
**`Direct` storage arm on the derived relation itself** (AST
`excl (direct [user]) (computed banned)`), with `banned := [user]` untainted and
a store granting `user:alice` through that Direct arm.

This is the leg-5d fragment's motivating shape, and it sits OUTSIDE the final
theorems' current scope on TWO counts (the honest record, 2026-07-20e):

* `W4Fragment.computedOnly` rejects the `direct` leaf in the derived def; the
  final `graph_correct`/`graph_reached_inv` are E-chain theorems
  (`graph_correct_w3d2E`), still `ComputedOnly`-scoped — widening them needs the
  operational enumeration model change (`enumJob2` → `enumJob2D`) plus a `_d`
  projection of `reachedByW3d2E_toC` (recorded follow-up, NOT done).
* `GraphAdmission.storeValid` (plain `StoreValidRules`) is FALSE at `Td`: the
  Direct arm sits under `excl`, so `exprDirects = []` on the derived def and a
  stored Direct-arm grant is only admissible under the WIDENED
  `StoreValidRulesD` (leg 5a) — `Td` is machine-checked to be genuinely outside
  the old bundle (`outside_old_admission` below).

What IS proved at this scope is the C-chain T2b **`graph_correct_w3d2_d`**
(`CascadeStrataResettle.lean`, audited): `check = sem` at every fully-drained
`ReachedByW3d2C` state on the Direct-arm fragment. The theorems below inhabit
its FULL hypothesis bundle at `Sd`/`Td` — `accepts` (the admission side, with
`StoreValidRulesD` in place of `storeValid`), `fragment` (the `_d` fragment
carries: `ComputedOrDirect` + `DirectArmsBare` + operand-`ComputedOnly` +
`hLU2` + `hWSbare` + `hNoUD` + the store disciplines), and `correct_applies`
(the bundle is JOINTLY dischargeable: `graph_correct_w3d2_d` instantiates at
the witness pair with every schema/store hypothesis closed). Non-vacuity of the
chain itself is operational: the Exec driver reaches drained `ReachedByW3d2C`
states over exactly this schema (attack-run 2026-07-20e: the 4-tuple corpus
store drains with `check = sem` on the full truth table). -/
