# W3d-2 E-chain tail — piece 1: the derived-leaf concrete decomposition (ROADMAP W3d-2)

`index_v4/processor.py:394-441` (`reconcile`'s per-pass audit enumeration) at a
STRATUM-2 key reads DERIVED operand leaves — so, beyond the store-supported reach
concretes (`_leaf_concretes`, W3d-1's `leafConcretes`), it must also pull the operand
RESIDUES' `neg` ids (`_derived_leaf_neg_ids`, `processor.py:461-495`) and the persisted
`upos` ids (`:425-429`): a lower-stratum `neg`/`upos` member is EDGE-FREE (I6) so it is
invisible to the reach-probe enumeration, yet it reads differently from its shape-star
at the derived leaf. This file is the routed analog of `CascadeEnum.lean`'s
`probeNonDerived_concrete_decomp` spine — the DERIVED-leaf decomposition.

## The spine at a derived leaf

For a concrete (star-free) subject `s` and a star-free object name `on`, the derived
operand leaf read (`probeDerived`, `State.lean:552`) reads exactly like its shape-star

  `probeDerived σ ⟨s, r', ⟨dt,on⟩⟩ = res.stars.contains s.shape`   (= its star's read)

UNLESS `s` triggers one of the three concrete-specific terms: an incoming edge
(`σ.reach (subjNode s) oN`), a `res.neg` membership, or a `res.upos` membership — where
`res = (σ.residue oN r').getD ∅` and `oN = objNode ⟨dt,on⟩ r'`. Those three are exactly
the state-derived RESIDUE-NAMED candidates (`residueNamed`) plus the edge holders. So a
subject in NEITHER reads as its shape-star at the derived leaf — the routed congruence
(`evalE_computedOnly`) then transports the whole tree, exactly as W3d-1's untainted
spine did off the reach probes. -/

/-! ## The routed reads-as-star lemma (off the unified W3d-2 enumeration)

The routed analog of `CascadeEnum.checkFn_eq_coveredFn_of_not_mem`. A star-free
subject that is NOT among the leaf concretes (untainted leaves, reach-based) AND NOT
residue-named at any derived leaf reads every operand leaf exactly as its shape-star,
so the routed compiled guard `checkFnR` reads it exactly as its shape-star's. Crucially
NO reach-collapse / settledness is needed here: a reach into any leaf's object node
already makes the subject a leaf concrete (`mem_leafConcretes_of_hit`), so
`∉ leafConcretes` gives `reach = false` directly. -/

`enumJob2` folds the residue-named candidates into W3d-1's `enumJob`: the per-key base
list is the leaf concretes (untainted-leaf reach) UNION the residue-named subjects of
every derived leaf. The four `W3dJobCoverage` clauses are then discharged exactly as in
W3d-1 (`w3dJobCoverage_enumJob`), with the ROUTED leg context (`hbridge`/`hcovDecl`
over `checkFnR`) in place of the unrouted one and `checkFnR_eq_star_of_not_enum` in
place of `checkFn_eq_coveredFn_of_not_mem`. The leg context itself is discharged at
actual W3d-2 states in a later increment (the routed bridge holds once the derived
operand keys are settled). -/

factored verbatim from `graph_correct_w3d2`'s `hsem_ws` block: a true routed star read

/-! ## `W3dJobCoverage` for `enumJob2` at a W3d-2 state

The state-level combining lemma: over any `ReachedByW3d2` state, given only that the
derived operand keys are settled+complete (`hsettledOps` — the single remaining
obligation the closure assembly discharges per round: vacuous at stratum-1/round-1
keys, from round-1 re-settlement at stratum-2/round-2 keys), `enumJob2`'s coverage
holds. The shadow (`reachedByW3d2_shadow`), edges-closedness
(`reachedByW3d2_edgesClosed`), the schema anchor, and the per-operand reach collapse
(`reachedByW3d2_reach_collapse_root`) are all read off the state. -/
