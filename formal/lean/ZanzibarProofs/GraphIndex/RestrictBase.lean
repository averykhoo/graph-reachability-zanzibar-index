# Schema restriction to the untainted fragment — the `hag` base reduction (ROADMAP W3a, Step A)

`graphRec_reduce_base` (`ReconcileCorrect.lean`) reduced the W3a correspondence blocker `hag`
to a pure W2 base-state fact: for an untainted operand relation `r'`, the graph read
`graphRec σ0 s dt on r'` on the untainted base `σ0` must equal `sem`. `graph_correct_rules`
proves exactly `check = sem`, but only under **whole-schema** `UntaintedSchema S` — too strong
for W3's *mixed* schema (one `RootBoolean` derived key + untainted operands).

This file builds the **schema-restriction** route (HANDOFF Step A, recommended): restrict `S` to
`S↾U := restrictUntainted S` (drop every tainted-key def), which IS untainted, then transfer
`sem` between `S` and `S↾U` on untainted keys so `graph_correct_rules` applies to `S↾U` as a
black box.

This increment lands the schema-combinatorial foundation + the **semantic heart**
`semAux_restrict`: on any untainted key, `sem` over `S` and over `S↾U` coincide (untaintedness
is hereditary — the taint fixpoint confines an untainted def's references to untainted keys, so
the evaluation of an untainted relation never consults a dropped def). Attack-first confirmed
(machine-checked `#eval` on a mixed `admin but not suspended` schema, then deleted): taint
isolates exactly the derived key, `schemaRewrites` is preserved, and `semAux` agrees on every
operand relation.

/-! ## The semantic heart — `sem` transfer on untainted keys

`semAux S ... = semAux (S↾U) ...` at every untainted key. By fuel induction: at an untainted
key the two schemas' definitions coincide (`restrictUntainted_lookup`); `evalE` then consults
`rec` only at that def's `exprRefs`, all untainted by heredity (`untainted_closed`), where the
IH supplies agreement — so `evalE_congr` closes the step. Needs `StoreDeclared S T` (the
admission-validity precondition `evalE_congr` requires for the `ttu` parent consultations). -/

/-- **`sem` transfer on untainted keys.** For every untainted key `(t, r)` (`isDerived S = false`)
    and every name `m`, the fuel-`f` `sem` reads over `S` and over `S↾U` coincide. Untaintedness
    is hereditary, so evaluating an untainted relation never touches a dropped derived def. This
    is the fact that lets `graph_correct_rules` (proved over `UntaintedSchema S↾U`) discharge the
    mixed-schema `hag`. -/

/-! ## The rewrite fan-out is preserved — the state-transfer groundwork

The graph write path reads the schema only through `schemaRewrites` (`rewriteStep` =
`(schemaRewrites S).filterMap …`; `writeDirect`/`admitEdge`/`reach` are schema-blind). On the
W3a fragment every *dropped* (tainted) def is `RootBoolean`, hence emits no rewrite arms
(`exprArms_rootBoolean`), so removing it leaves `schemaRewrites` — and therefore the whole
rewrite fan-out — unchanged. This is the groundwork for transferring a `ReachedByRules`/
`…Admitted` state from `S` to `S↾U` with identical edges. -/

/-- Flat-mapping over a filtered list drops nothing when the removed elements map to `[]`. -/

/-- **`schemaRewrites` is preserved by the restriction** — given the W3a fragment fact that every
    tainted (dropped) def emits no rewrite arms. The relations of `schemaRewrites S` are all
    untainted (an arm's `outRel` is its def's own relation, and tainted defs emit none), so the
    rewrite fan-out lives entirely in the untainted cone that `S↾U` keeps. -/

/-! ## The fuel bridge — closure membership across the fuel gap

The canonical closures run at DIFFERENT fuels: `rewriteClosure S t` at `|S.keys|+1`,
`rewriteClosure (S↾U) t` at the smaller `|S↾U.keys|+1`. Via `rewriteClosureAux_restrict`,
`rewriteClosure (S↾U) t = rewriteClosureAux S (|S↾U.keys|+1) [t]`, so the two canonical
closures are the SAME `S`-closure recurrence at two fuels. The gap direction that is
*unconditional* — the smaller closure embeds in the bigger one — is landed here (fuel
monotonicity + the key-count bound). The reverse embedding (the bigger closure adds no new
members past the smaller fuel) needs saturation of the smaller closure and is deferred to
the `RewriteRanked (S↾U)` step. -/

/-- **Fuel monotonicity of the bounded rewrite closure.** More fuel never drops a member:
    a closure member sits at some layer `k ≤ n` (`stepN_of_mem_aux`), and `k ≤ m` re-embeds
    it (`mem_aux_of_stepN`). Reads only the layer algebra of `RulesSaturate`. -/

    runs at the smaller fuel `|S↾U.keys|+1 ≤ |S.keys|+1`, so fuel monotonicity re-embeds it.
    This is the `⊇` half of the fuel bridge (`sem`-completeness side is unaffected). -/

/-! ## The `⊆` half — the `S`-closure embeds in the `S↾U`-closure (via saturation)

The bigger closure adds no new members past the smaller fuel: the `S↾U`-closure is
saturated (closed under one more `rewriteStep S`), so it swallows every `S`-closure layer.
Saturation needs `RewriteRanked (S↾U)`, which we build from `RewriteRanked S` by rank
COMPRESSION — count the `S↾U`-keys ranked below `k` — bounded now by `|S↾U.keys|`. The one
faithful side condition: every rewrite's *match* key is a declared untainted relation
(`RewriteMatchDeclared`), so the compressed rank strictly increases at each arm. -/

/-- **`RewriteMatchDeclared S`** — every schema rewrite's *match* key `(objectType, matchRel)`
    is a declared, untainted relation. Faithful to the compiler: rewrite arms are compiled
    from operand reads routed through `RewriteFilter`s over DECLARED relations, and in the
    boolean fragment every operand is untainted. This is what confines each rewrite step to
    the untainted cone `S↾U` keeps, so the compressed rank (below) can be bounded by

    pointwise implies `q` and some `a ∈ l` is counted by `q` but not `p`, the `q`-filter is
    strictly longer. (`p`-filter is a `q`-sublist by monotonicity; equal length would force

    it: its match key `a` (declared untainted, `RewriteMatchDeclared` ⇒ `a ∈ S↾U.keys`) is

/-! ## The state transfer — a canonical admitted `S↾U`-state with agreeing edges

The base `hag` equation reads the graph on an admitted rule-routed state `σ0` over the MIXED
schema `S`, but `graph_correct_rules` (`check = sem`) needs a state built over an UNTAINTED
schema. This section transfers `σ0` to a canonical `ReachedByRulesAdmitted σ' (S↾U) T` whose
edges have identical membership.

The one subtlety flagged by the roadmap: σ' and σ0 fold `writeDirect` over DIFFERENT lists
(`rewriteClosure (S↾U) t` vs `rewriteClosure S t`, which differ by fuel/dups), so they are not
literally equal — and admission (`FoldAdmits`, cycle-rejection) is order-sensitive. The bridge
is that admission depends only on the *final* edge relation being acyclic: `foldAdmits_of_acyclic`
shows every `writeDirect` in a fold admits as long as each materialised edge lands in an acyclic
relation `Ef` that already contains the running edges. Since `σ0.edges` is acyclic (`Inv.acyclic`)
and the fuel bridge makes the two closures materialise the SAME edges, both states' admissions —
and hence their edge sets — coincide. -/

/-- **Admission from acyclicity of the target relation.** Folding `writeDirect` over `us` from
    `σ` admits every write, provided (i) `Ef` is acyclic, (ii) `σ`'s edges already sit inside
    `Ef`, and (iii) every write's materialised edge is in `Ef`. Each step: the edge `a → b`
    is not a self-loop (`(a,a) ∈ Ef` would be a 1-cycle) and has no back-path `b →* a` in the
    running edges (which embed in `Ef`, so `b →* a → b` would be a cycle). The write keeps the
    running edges inside `Ef` (`writeDirect_edges`), so the induction proceeds. Order-insensitive:
    the only input from `us` is its set of materialised edges. -/

/-- **The state transfer.** From an admitted rule-routed state `σ0` over the mixed schema `S`,
    build a canonical admitted state `σ'` over the untainted restriction `S↾U` whose edges have
    identical membership. Both states' edges are exactly the materialised rewrite-closure tuples
    (`reachedByRules_edge_sound` ⊆ / `reachedByRulesAdmitted_edge_complete` ⊇), and the fuel
    bridge (`rewriteClosure_restrict_mem_iff`) makes the two closures agree — so the edge sets
    agree. The admissions transfer via `foldAdmits_of_acyclic` (target `σ0.edges`, acyclic by
    `Inv.acyclic`). Proof by induction on the write path; the fragment side conditions (`hDrop`,
    `RewriteMatchDeclared`, `RewriteRanked`) are premises, faithful and discharged in assembly. -/
