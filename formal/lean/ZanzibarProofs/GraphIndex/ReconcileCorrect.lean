# The derived reconcile — the `check_fn` ↔ `sem`-step reduction (ROADMAP W3a, read half — increment 1)

`Reconcile.lean` collapsed the derived read to the bare edge probe on a `ResidueEmpty`
state; `ReconcileWrite.lean` modelled the write (`reconcileKey` = a guarded `writeDirect`
fold materialising a derived edge per candidate iff `checkFn`). What remains for
`graph_correct_w3a` is the *correspondence*: the reconcile materialises a derived edge
for `s` **iff** `s` is a `sem`-member of the derived key.

This increment lands the first spine of that correspondence — the **`checkFn` ↔
`sem`-step reduction**. On the W3a fragment the derived def is a boolean tree
(`and`/`but not`/`or`) whose leaves are all `computed` references to (untainted,
single-stratum) sub-relations — captured by `ComputedOnly` below. On such a tree `evalE`
consults its node-recursion `rec` only at `(dt, on, ·)` (it never reaches a
`direct`/`ttu` leaf), so the graph-reading `checkFn` and one `sem` immediate-consequence
step of the derived key coincide **exactly when the graph read and the fuel-`f` `sem`
read agree on every `computed` operand** — `checkFn_eq_semStep`.

This isolates the remaining W3a blocker (PROOF_STATUS "W3 STARTED", point 1) to precisely
that per-relation agreement `graphRec σ s dt on r' = semAux S s T q f dt on r'`, an
untainted-relation graph↔`sem` fact the W2 correspondence supplies (restated per-relation
within the mixed schema) — and the T0a fuel-stability sidestep for the fuel index.

/-- **`ComputedOnly e`** — the W3a derived-def shape: a boolean tree (`union` / `inter` /
    `excl`) whose leaves are all `computed` references. No `direct` / `ttu` leaves — those
    route onto leaf families and add the storage / rule-leaf split deferred past W3a. This
    is the "derived boolean over `computed` refs to untainted relations" fragment the
    attack-first `#eval` corpus confirmed. -/

/-- **`evalE` on a computed-only expr reads only `rec` at `(dt, on, ·)`.** Two `rec`s
    agreeing there evaluate the whole tree identically — independently of the subject,
    store, query and enclosing relation (a computed-only tree never reaches a
    `direct` / `ttu` leaf, the only places those are consulted). This is the congruence
    that lets `checkFn`'s graph node-recursion be swapped for `sem`'s fuel recursion. -/

/-- **`checkFn` equals the derived key's `sem`-step, given per-relation agreement.**
    On the W3a fragment (`ComputedOnly` derived def `e = lookup (dt, R)`), the compiled
    `check_fn` for the fixed bare subject `s` — `evalE` with node-recursion reading the
    graph (`graphRec`) — coincides with one `sem` immediate-consequence step of the
    derived key, **provided** the graph read and the fuel-`f` `sem` read agree on every
    `computed` operand at `(dt, on, ·)`.

    This is the first spine of the W3a correspondence: it reduces `checkFn = sem`-membership
    (the reconcile guard) to exactly the per-relation agreement
    `graphRec σ s dt on r' = semAux S s T q f dt on r'`, which the untainted operands' W2
    correspondence supplies (restated per-relation within the mixed schema), plus the
    fuel-stability sidestep for the fuel index. -/
