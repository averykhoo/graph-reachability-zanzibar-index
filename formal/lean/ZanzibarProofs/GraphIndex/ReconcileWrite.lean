# The derived reconcile — the WRITE model (ROADMAP W3a, write half)

`SEMANTICS.md` §7.6, §7.8; `index_v4/processor.py` (`reconcile` / `reconcile_subject`
/ `_EvalContext`). This is the write half of W3a (star-free, bare-subject derived
booleans), mirroring how W1b/W1c/W2 each landed a "write model DONE" increment before
the read correspondence.

## The processor's `check_fn` (`processor.py:43-56`, `410`)

`reconcile` computes, per candidate bare subject `s`, `should := check_fn(ctx, s)` and
maintains a derived edge `subjNode s → objNode ⟨dt,on⟩ R` iff `should ∧ ¬covered` (on
star-free data `covered` is always `false`, so `should` alone decides — §7.6, P4). The
compiled `check_fn` evaluates the boolean tree of the derived def; on the W3a fragment
(operands are `computed` references to **untainted** relations — a single stratum)
*every* leaf dispatches to `_EvalContext.leaf_check` = `widx.check` = the graph's
≤4-probe reachability read (`probeNonDerived`). So `check_fn` is exactly `evalE` with
the node-recursion `rec` reading the graph instead of the fuel recursion — see
`checkFn` below.

A derived edge is *structurally* an ordinary `writeDirect ⟨s, R, o⟩` (guarded,
cycle-rejecting, residue-untouched), so W3a reuses ALL of W2's `writeDirect` fold
machinery (`inv_foldl_writeDirect` etc.). The whole write model here is therefore a
guarded fold; its structural/`Inv`/residue-free/quiescence preservation is immediate.

**Deferred to the correspondence increment:** `checkFn σ s = sem`-membership of `s`
(via W1/W2 for the untainted operands + `evalE_congr`), and candidate-completeness
(every `sem`-member is enumerated) — together giving `probeDerived = sem` through the
W3a read collapse (`Reconcile.lean:probeDerived_residueEmpty`).

    evaluation on the W3a fragment (`processor.py:410`, `check_fn(ctx, (pred,type,

    passes (`reconcileKey`). The star-free bare-subject derived-boolean closure; it
    stays residue-free (derived relations only add edges on W3a), so `probeDerived`
    collapses to the edge probe (`Reconcile.lean`). The base leg pins the untainted
    edges to the store; each reconcile leg adds `check_fn`-selected derived edges. -/

    passes), never postulated. The residue-free conjunct is what makes the derived
    read collapse to the edge probe (`probeDerived_ResidueEmpty`). -/
