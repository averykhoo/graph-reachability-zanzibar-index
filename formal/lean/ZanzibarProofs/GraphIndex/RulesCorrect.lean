# The untainted rule-routing read correspondence (ROADMAP W2, read half — IN PROGRESS)

`SEMANTICS.md` §7.5. The W2 write half (`RulesWrite.lean`) materializes a raw write's
rewrite-closure as ordinary direct edges. This file builds the read correspondence
`check = sem` on the **untainted** fragment (`computed`/`union`/`ttu`, no `and`/`but
not`). This increment lands the **read-routing** reduction: on an untainted schema no
key is derived, so `GraphModel.check` routes to `probeNonDerived` (pure reachability) —
the same read path W1's `graph_correct_*` theorems glue against.

The remaining, genuinely-new content — `TupleChain over the rewrite-closure ↔ sem over
the raw store` (the rewrite-closure realizing `evalE`'s computed/ttu/union recursion) —
is the deferred next increment (see PROOF_STATUS "W2 STARTED").

/-! ## The untainted fragment predicate -/

/-- **`UntaintedSchema S`** — no definition uses a boolean operator (`and`/`but not`),
    i.e. every def is built from `direct`/`computed`/`ttu`/`union`. This is exactly the
    W2 scope: on it, taint never propagates, so every relation is read via the
    reachability probes (never the residue path). -/

/-! ## Taint collapses on the untainted fragment -/

/-- On an untainted schema, no key is base-tainted (whatever the lookup outcome). -/

/-! ## The read routes to `probeNonDerived` -/

/-- **On the untainted fragment the graph read is pure reachability.** Since no key is
    derived, `check` never takes the residue path — it reduces to the ≤4-probe
    `probeNonDerived`, the same read `graph_correct_direct`/`_bareStar`/`_objStar`/
    `_usStar` glue against. This is the routing half of the W2 correspondence. -/

/-! ## Soundness groundwork — edges trace back to rewrite-closure tuples

For the deferred reachability ⇒ `sem` half, the edge set must be pinned to the store's
rewrite-closure. `writeRules` folds `writeDirect` over `rewriteClosure S t`, so every
edge is either an old edge or the materialization of some closure tuple — the W2 analog
of `reachedByDirect_edge_sound`. Unconditional, reusable. -/

/-- Folding `writeDirect` over `us`: every resulting edge is an old edge of `σ` or the
    materialization `subjNode u.subject → objNode u.object u.relation` of some `u ∈ us`. -/
theorem foldl_writeDirect_edges_sound (us : List Tuple) :
    ∀ {σ : GraphState} {a b : NodeKey},
      (a, b) ∈ (us.foldl (fun acc u => acc.writeDirect u) σ).edges →
      (a, b) ∈ σ.edges ∨

/-- **Every edge of a W2-reached state materializes a rewrite-closure tuple.** By
    induction over the rule-routed write path: a fresh edge comes from some `u` in the
    rewrite-closure of the just-written `t`; an old edge is handled by the IH. The
    soundness-half groundwork for `graph_correct_rules` — a graph path is a chain of
    rewrite-closure materializations, which the `sem`-correspondence will match against
    `evalE`'s computed/ttu/union recursion. -/

/-! ## The storage-only tupleset fragment condition (attack-first finding)

**Attack-first (2026-07-10, machine-checked `#eval`, then deleted): the W2
`check = sem` correspondence is FALSE without a `_validate_ttu_tuplesets` side
condition.** Counterexample: schema `doc#viewer := ttu member parent`,
`doc#parent := computed linked`, `doc#linked := direct [group]`,
`group#member := direct [user]`; store `(group:g, linked, doc:d)`,
`(user:alice, member, group:g)`; query `check(alice, viewer, doc:d)`.

The graph rewrite-fanout of `(g, linked, d)` cascades `linked ↦ parent` (computed)
then fires the TTU rule on the *rewrite-produced* `(g, parent, d)`, materialising
`g#member → viewer(d)`, so `check = true`. But `sem`'s `ttuLeaf` reads only
**stored** `parent` tuples (there are none — `parent` is computed), so `sem = false`.
**Divergence.** With a directs-only `parent` (a raw stored tupleset) the two agree.

This is exactly what `zanzibar_utils_v1.py:_validate_ttu_tuplesets` rejects at
compile: an *untainted* tupleset relation with computed/rewritten arms. Note
`GraphAccepts` clause (3) does NOT catch it — a `computed`-armed tupleset is
untainted (`isDerived = false`), so it passes `GraphAccepts` yet must be excluded
here. The W2 fragment therefore carries `TtuTuplesetsDirect` below; the operational
payoff (`closure_tupleset_is_seed`) is that the graph only ever lands the *raw*
seed on a tupleset relation, so the deferred ttu correspondence reads raw tuplesets
exactly as `ttuLeaf` does. -/

/-- **`directsOnly e`** — every arm of `e` is a `Direct` leaf (a `Direct` or a
    `union` of directs-only). Faithful to `zanzibar_utils_v1.py:_directs_only`. A
    directs-only relation has no `computed`/`ttu` arm, so it is never a rewrite
    *output* (`exprArms_directsOnly`). -/
def directsOnly : Expr → Bool
  | .direct _  => true
  | .union a b => directsOnly a && directsOnly b
  | .computed _ => false
  | .ttu _ _   => false
  | .inter _ _ => false
  | .excl _ _  => false

/-- **`TtuTuplesetsDirect S`** — the untainted-fragment analog of
    `_validate_ttu_tuplesets` (`zanzibar_utils_v1.py:898`): every TTU's tupleset
    relation, *for every declared def carrying that key*, is directs-only. (Python
    keys a dict, so "every def with the key" = "the def"; stating it over all
    matching defs makes `no_rewrite_outputs_tupleset` need no separate key-uniqueness
    lemma, and is implied by the dict semantics.) This is the side condition that
    makes the W2 correspondence true — without it `check ≠ sem` (see the finding
    above). -/
def TtuTuplesetsDirect (S : Schema) : Prop :=
  ∀ d ∈ S.defs, ∀ tt ∈ exprTtus d.2,
    ∀ d' ∈ S.defs, d'.1 = (d.1.1, tt.2) → directsOnly d'.2 = true

/-! ### `exprArms` provenance -/

/-- A rewrite rule from `exprArms ot rel e` carries exactly `(objectType, outRel) =
    (ot, rel)` — the object type and relation of the def it was extracted from. -/

    never the output relation of any rewrite. -/

    A rule with `objectType = ot` and `outRel = ts` would come from a def with key
    `(ot, ts)`, which `TtuTuplesetsDirect` forces directs-only — contributing no arms
    (`exprArms_directsOnly`), a contradiction. -/
