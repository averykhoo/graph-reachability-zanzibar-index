`index_v4/invariants.py::verify_outbox_deltas`

**Measured (2026-08-17 motivating-measurement pass):** **11.0%** of a paranoid build — O(pairs × edges) per commit where O(sources × edges) suffices. Gate wall-clock, not a production win; already recorded as a known cost in `perf-next-round.md`’s minor notes.

**Verdict: MOTIVATED — still to land.** Position **9 of 10** in the audit’s recommended order (`R6-6 → R6-11 → R6-5 → R6-4 → R6-9 → R6-18 → R6-16 → R6-7 → R6-8 → R6-1`). That order is a RECOMMENDATION and is deliberately NOT encoded as `deps`; neither is `R6-16`’s co-design requirement, which is simultaneity rather than precedence and lives in the traps of `R6-16`/`R6-7`/`R6-8`. **No row in this round has `deps`.**

## Traps

⚠ **Read your id’s entry in [`perf-round6-audit-2026-08.md`](docs/perf-round6-audit-2026-08.md) — INCLUDING its verifier corrections — and that file’s §"Traps the numbers do not carry", before taking this id.** The audit’s own rule: *do not implement from titles alone*. Eighteen findings survived adversarial verification with **0 refuted**, but several impacts were downgraded, several fix sketches were corrected, and one fix was refuted outright while its finding stood.

⚠ **This item rewrites an ASSURANCE CHECKER**, so [`docs/sabotage-procedure.md`](docs/sabotage-procedure.md) binds it: the rewritten check must be sabotaged red before it is trusted. A faster checker that no longer checks is this repo’s house failure mode.

⚠ **The fix must test BFS *neighbours*, not the seen-set** — otherwise `(s, s)` reads as reachable on corrupt state and the verifier stops catching exactly the corruption it exists to catch.

⚠ **Co-design with `R6-16` — do not take this one alone** (see its entry); no `deps` edge encodes it, because `deps` is precedence and this is simultaneity.

⚠ **Decompose every cumulative share before quoting it as a target.** `R6-10`’s headline 59.8% was CUMULATIVE; decomposed it was `_direct_incoming` 28.4% + `_nodes_by_ids` 30.7%, and the realised win came from the two SELECTs, not the headline. `R6-19` is the same trap caught earlier.

## Read first

- [`docs/perf-round6-audit-2026-08.md`](docs/perf-round6-audit-2026-08.md) §`### R6-8` — the entry, **including its verifier corrections**
- the same file, §"Traps the numbers do not carry" — the round-wide traps. Read the section; it is short, and it is the only home for how many there are. (This line used to say "the five", attributed to `migrate.py` recounting them at generation time. `migrate.py` was deleted with `.scratch/tasktool/` on 2026-09-07, so the attribution named a mechanism that could not run — `TK61`, reworded 2026-09-07b. A bare "five" with no attribution would have been worse: that is an unsourced restated count.)
- [`R6_PROFILE_2026-08-17.md`](benchmarks/results/R6_PROFILE_2026-08-17.md) — verdicts, method, and the two honest limits (in-memory SQLite understates statement-count wins; cProfile depresses throughput)
- `index_v4/invariants.py::verify_outbox_deltas` — the code
- [`docs/perf-next-round.md`](docs/perf-next-round.md) — the fence and the reopening rule
- `python task.py show R6` — the parent: round-wide order, traps and the re-run recipe (`python -m benchmarks.profile_r6[_write] --target <t>`, never beside another bench or a pytest run)

## Log

### 2026-08-21

**Migrated by `migrate.py`, and this row is a CORRECTION.** The first migration pass classified every id whose disposition string was not literally `closed` as retired, which wrote this live item into `retired-ids.txt` — an irreversible sink, since `task.py` refuses to re-mint a retired id. Its true disposition (`MOTIVATED, unlanded`) is taken from `docs/perf-round6-audit-2026-08.md`, the audit that owns these ids, not from the `R6` board row’s summary prose (which undercounts the land list by one and overcounts the declines by one). `parent: R6` makes the round a rollup: closing the last child is what reports that `R6` itself can close. **`created` (`2026-08-15`) is RECORDED, not approximated** — it is the date the audit doc that minted these ids states for itself; `moved` is the `R6` board row’s value.
