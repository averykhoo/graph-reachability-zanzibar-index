# Decision log

Load-bearing decisions with their rejected alternatives, compressed from the three
specs (`docs/specs/`). Dated *implementation* divergences live in
`docs/spec-deviations.md`; this file is the "why is it like this at all" record.
Do not re-walk these without new evidence — the alternatives were considered.

## Graph index

* **Path-counted closure rows** over interval/2-hop/PLL labelings and per-object
  bitmaps: labelings have non-constant queries and degrade under deletion; bitmap
  bits can't be ref-counted for exact removal. Under OMv-style lower bounds nothing
  gets both fast updates and fast queries — the query-optimal corner is chosen
  deliberately; multiplicative path counting is what makes removal exact.
* **Cycle rejection is a counting necessity**, not a policy: a cycle means infinite
  path multiplicity. Hence also: self-referential wildcard tuples rejected (the
  bridge+grant pair closes a loop), while object-star self-containment is fine
  (subject-role and object-role are different nodes; entity nodes have in-degree 0).
* **Split wildcard nodes** (`w_any`/`w_all`, never bridged to each other) over a
  single `*` node: prevents the instance leak (being an instance ≠ receiving what is
  distributed to instances). Interior wildcard hops are materialised as bridges so
  check stays ≤4 probes; only query-endpoint hops stay virtual.
* **Store-granularity writer lock** (`_lock_store`) over per-edge locking: the
  affected closure region is discovered while walking, so piecemeal locking in graph
  order invites deadlocks; one logical write already touches many rows.

## Set engine

* **Raw tuples (`TupleV1`) are the ground truth**; all set state is in-memory,
  rebuilt by replay on open. Bitmap snapshot persistence rejected (opaque, duplicates
  state).
* **Reference-counted interner with recycled int32 ids**: `(type, name, predicate)`
  is the stable surrogate; memory tracks live entities, not lifetime. Never
  `isinstance`-check the underlying set type — everything goes through the `SetOps`
  seam (roaring/pyset must be indistinguishable; the matrix runs both).
* **`MemberSet (pos, stars, neg)`** carries the pinned star×boolean table:
  stars fold ∪=`|`, ∩=`&`, ∖=`-`; `pos` wins over `neg`; concrete-only exclusions
  never defeat star queries.

## Boolean relations in the graph index (the IVM build)

* **Materialisation as ordinary edges in the SAME closure** over check-time
  expression evaluation: check-time eval can't support anything *downstream* of a
  boolean (TTU over a boolean viewer, userset restrictions, nested booleans).
  Materialised derived edges re-enter the closure and emit their own deltas, which
  drive the next stratum. Strata are logical, never physical — one store, one
  transaction.
* **Taint propagates** (a pure union over a boolean relation is derived): star-covered
  members have no edges, so compiling it normally would silently drop them.
* **Symbolic state is a per-object residue row** (`stars`, `neg`, `upos`) — not
  derived w-edges (splits one relation's symbolic state across two writers +
  bridge-GC interactions), not extensional star expansion (unbounded, ghost-wrong,
  and cycle-creating for self-including universals).
* **Deltas are invalidation signals, never state transfers**; reconciliation is
  recompute-from-committed-state, idempotent. The §5.4 rule is load-bearing: a
  symbolic delta must reconcile the concrete edge-holders on that object, not just
  the residue (blocked:`[user:*]` arriving produces no concrete delta for bob, yet
  must revoke his edge).
* **Canonical representation**: star-covered members hold no edges (residue answers);
  uncovered bare-entity members hold an edge iff true; **userset members never hold
  edges** — a derived edge from a userset node would leak through the closure past
  each member's own pointwise exclusion, so true userset memberships live in the
  residue's `upos` (pos-without-transitivity; blind-audit P4/D2). Required for
  permutation invariance and the "star-only members: zero edges" space rule.
* **Synchronous v1, in-transaction outbox cascade**; no SAVEPOINTs (a failed
  reconcile must abort the whole write; SAVEPOINT-per-delta is the future async
  worker's tool, noted with the pysqlite transaction-boundary caveat).
* **Stratification is mandatory**; recursion through a boolean relation is a compile
  error. Termination of the cascade follows from idempotent reconciliation; the
  quiescence assert enforces it.
* **Namespacing lives in the predicate name** (`<relation>.<index>`, `.` reserved in
  declarations); classification is the compiled namespace map keyed
  `(object_type, predicate)` — no `family` column (a drift surface duplicating
  name-derivable information).
* **TTU parents = stored tupleset tuples** (oracle-pinned Zanzibar semantics).
  Storage leaves are split from rule-routed leaves so "stored tuples of a derived
  relation" is a well-defined edge set. This is also why decision 15's rejection of
  derived-tupleset TTUs could be lifted (the frozen acceptance event required it):
  parents are data-bounded stored tuples, not an object-star-shaped computed set.
* **Raw-tuple set semantics at the API boundary** (duplicate add = no-op) while the
  core stays ref-counted: two *different* raw tuples may rewrite to the same derived
  edge, so counts are load-bearing internally — but Zanzibar raw tuples are a set.
* **Scope hooks, not features**: object wildcards on derived relations and wildcard
  usersets over derived relations both need symbolic composition through residues
  (a symmetric subject-keyed residue) — loud compile errors until someone builds it.

## The connected store (round 2)

* **Source-of-truth / materialized-view split** (Zanzibar/Leopard): tuples live in
  `TupleV1` + a permanent log; the graph index is downstream and owns nothing.
  "Reconstruct tuples from the index" was rejected — likely possible in principle
  (topo-order peeling with path-count subtraction) but it's the whole forward engine
  reimplemented in reverse, kept bug-for-bug in sync forever, to recover data one
  table keeps losslessly.
* **Schemas are static, write-once, stored as SOURCE** (`SchemaV4`); compiled
  artifacts are cache (closures can't be persisted; stored compiled state is a
  drift surface — the `family`-column argument again). A new schema = a new
  store/index built from the tuples; no versioning, no migration.
* **The tuple log is permanent** (audit + replay + token domain; human-scale
  volume); bootstrap-from-snapshot keeps builds independent of log length, so
  compaction stays a hook.
* **One apply step, two schedules**: sync = the async worker inlined into the write
  transaction. The coupling is a temporary *schedule*, not temporary machinery.
* **Validity at admission** keeps the log replayable: the write path enforces full
  parity (incl. graph-cycle rejection via the set engine's flow graph), so an
  apply-time rejection is a corruption signal — no dead-letter mechanism.
* **Exactly-once by transactionality**: applied rows + cursor advance commit
  together; the applier locks the index store before reading the cursor
  (lost-update prevention).
* **Freshness tokens are log ids** (zookie-lite): index serves iff cursor ≥ token,
  else the set engine answers fresh — Leopard's timestamp merge simplified to a
  fallback. (Round 3 makes the fallback O(delta) and honors `at_least` on
  `TupleSource.check` too.)

## The connected store (round 3 — multi-instance / HA)

* **Multi-instance set engines via log tailing, not gossip.** Several
  `TupleSource`/`ConnectedStore` instances (one `Session` each) share a store; each
  set engine is instance-local in-memory, resynced by tailing `TupleLogV1`
  (`SetEngine.apply_logged` per committed row — the O(delta) analog of `rebuild()`,
  which is O(store)). The DB log is the *only* inter-instance channel — instance
  gossip was rejected as a second, redundant consistency surface. Consequence:
  every instance's state is the fold of an exact log *prefix* (prefix consistency —
  instances differ only in recency, never sideways); un-tokened replica reads are
  bounded-stale by tail cadence; read-your-writes/causal reads reuse the existing
  log-id token on `at_least` (now honored on `TupleSource.check`, not only
  `ConnectedStore.check`).
* **Log ids REMAIN the token** — no snowflake/ULID/lamport clock. Store-local
  autoincrement log ids already totally-order a store's history and are the cursor
  domain; a global clock buys nothing until *cross-store* tokens are in scope (they
  are not — X6). The round-1 brainstorm's timestamp menu is closed.
* **Source-lock write discipline** (`_lock_source`: `FOR UPDATE` on the `SchemaV4`
  row) over lock-free admission: a write is a check-then-act against instance-local
  memory (duplicate / remove-existence / cycle parity), sound only if no other
  instance can commit between the catch-up and this write's commit. Taking the lock
  → `catch_up_evaluator` → validate → append in one transaction serializes writers
  at store granularity. **This also closes a latent pre-existing hazard**: the log
  append used to flush its autoincrement id *before* any lock, so concurrent writers
  on PostgreSQL could commit log ids out of order and a tailer (or `advance_index`'s
  cursor) could permanently skip a row. Ids now commit in id order per store.
  Lock-ordering invariant: source lock (`SchemaV4`) before graph store lock
  (`StoreV4`) — one global order, deadlock-free.
* **Correctness over per-write cost** in the degenerate single-writer case: the lock
  never contends and catch-up is one empty indexed SELECT, so the cost is one
  `FOR UPDATE` SELECT (no-op-rendered on SQLite) + one empty log SELECT per write —
  accepted deliberately rather than branching the write path on a deployment
  assumption.
* **`at_least` is check-only — lookup/reverse-lookup/expand deliberately excluded**
  (not "can't", "didn't": the token mechanics are the same five lines). Three costs
  `check` doesn't have, plus a structural point:
  1. *Result domain.* `check` returns a bool, so the freshness fallback (graph when
     fresh, set engine when lagging) is invisible. The lookup surfaces return ids —
     graph node ids (DB rows) vs set-engine interner ids (instance-local, recycled)
     — so a fallback silently switches the id domain of the same call depending on
     index lag. Prerequisite: redefine the public lookup contract in the portable
     `(type, name, predicate)` key + marker domain for BOTH backends
     (`SetEngine.result_keys` is that form; the graph side needs the twin), a
     breaking/versioned API change in its own right.
  2. *Perf cliff.* Graph lookup is probes over the materialized closure — the point
     of that backend; the set engine's is a check-verified reverse walk (correct,
     oracle-pinned, expensive). A tokened `check` fallback costs one pointwise
     evaluation; a tokened lookup fallback silently turns a hot enumeration into a
     full reverse walk whenever the worker lags. That degradation should be a
     visible, chosen behavior, not an implicit one.
  3. *Test surface.* `tests/test_lookup_oracle.py` is the strictest gate in the
     repo (the X1–X4 history); a lagging-index fallback leg doubles its matrix
     (fresh vs lagging × backends × token boundaries) — a deliberate follow-up
     arc, not a rider.
  Structurally: a lagging reader cannot make the index fresh itself
  (`advance_index` is the writer/worker's job — store lock, closure mutation), so
  the set-engine fallback is the only non-blocking option, which is exactly where
  costs 1–2 bite. **Shape of the future work**: unify the lookup result contract on
  keys/markers → add the same `at_least` plumbing as `check` → extend the lookup
  oracle gate with a lagging-index leg (mostly test-writing).
* **Out of scope** (this round): snapshot / "at exactly" reads (only `at_least`
  lower-bounding); cross-store tokens (X6 — store-local); instance gossip (the DB
  log is the channel); schema-version skew (schemas are write-once — a new schema
  is a new store).

## Non-goals (documented hooks only)

Async outbox workers; exposing derived-relation deltas to external consumers;
cross-query caching; snapshot ("at exactly") reads and cross-store zookies (the
zookie-lite log-id token and multi-instance catch-up ARE built — see round 3);
automatic outbox pruning; residue GC beyond empty-row deletion; lenient ∀⇒∃; a
`family` metadata column; Rete-style general incremental matching; 64-bit id space;
query-time node interning.
