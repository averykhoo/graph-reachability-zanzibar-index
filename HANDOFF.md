# HANDOFF — the board

The **priority view of every open item in this repo**, `formal/` included, and the only
file that ranks them. Formal *execution* state — what is proved, what the next lemma is —
lives in [`formal/HANDOFF.md`](formal/HANDOFF.md), and any formal item's read-first list
starts there. Durable rules, the gate, the env and the standing footguns are in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) (auto-loaded every session); doc conventions — liveness states,
the signal legend, citation keys — are in [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).

**A user-assigned task overrides this board.** Do not re-rank at session start: work the
task, then re-rank once at write-back. `NOW` means "what I would recommend an unassigned
session pick up", not "what I am doing".

Read this file fully plus `CLAUDE.md`, then **only your item's read-first list**. End of
session: run the Rhythm protocol at the bottom.

## Board

Priority is a word, and the top two are capacity-bounded: `NOW` = exactly 1, `NEXT` ≤ 3.
`LATER` / `HOLD` / `SOMEDAY` are unbounded. Legend and budgets:
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) §4. `deps` names **open** rows only — closing a row
sweeps its id out of every `deps` cell. `moved` is the last date a session progressed or
re-ranked the item, so an old date on a `NOW`/`NEXT` row means neglect. **Ids carry
forward forever and are never reused.**

| id | item (→ pointer) | pri | size | deps | moved |

Closed ids stay retired: `P1`, `P2`, `HS-1`, `HS-3` (all done 2026-08-16), `GS-1`, `BL-1` (2026-08-21),
`HS-4` and `GS-2` (2026-08-17), `HS-2` (2026-08-20b), `B1`, and the whole `ZT-*` zero-trust series. `B2` survives as the historical grouping of `P8` + `P9`.
`B1`'s underlying finding was verified closed on 2026-08-16 (both halves proved 2026-07-28
and 2026-08-04; the record had simply never caught up) — evidence in `formal/HANDOFF.md`'s
`B1` block. Retiring an id is not the same act as closing a finding: say which you mean —
`BL-1` is both (fixed 2026-08-21, and its two pins stay green as regression guards).
⚠ **Do not reflow those two `Closed ids` lines.** `handoff_lint.py::check_ledger_ids`
harvests retired ids LINE BY LINE (only lines carrying `Closed ids stay retired` or
`survives as the historical grouping` are read), so rewrapping moves ids out of scope —
**and the FAILs then blame the LEDGER's citations, not this rewrap**. Observed 2026-08-21:
one reflow produced six FAILs for ids that were retired the whole time. If this check fails
on ids you never touched, `git diff HANDOFF.md` before believing the message.

## Item blocks — `NOW` and `NEXT` only

These blocks have **replace** semantics: if you touch the item, rewrite its block,
read-first list included. Rows below `NEXT` deliberately get no block — their pointer
target is self-sufficient by construction (verified row by row, 2026-08-16).

### `P3` — leg 7: step 4c-ii co-landing with step 7, in one commit

Re-point the rule-routed write path onto leaf-indexed targets and retire projection `P6` in
the same commit. Critical path, the only multi-session phase, and **no longer blocked**:
**Route B — weaken `UntaintedShadow` — was adjudicated 2026-08-20b** (user call). No-kill at
all five `LeafRules.lean` witnesses on both chains; **~123 sites**, template lemmas exist,
**zero cone beyond the 39 modules 4c-ii pays anyway**. It absorbs `P14`'s classification
half, which breaks the old cycle. Evidence, polarity census, corrected per-chain proposition
and both sabotage records: PROOF_STATUS `2026-08-20b` + scope doc §11.9.

⚠ **Seven traps live in scope doc §11.10**, demoted there 2026-08-20b at the trap budget —
the backwards own-key premise, the leading-conjunct ordering, the 24 `FoldAdmits` sites, the
derived (not re-recorded) golden expectation, and the two premises Route B's equivalence
argument rests on. **Read §11.10 before touching the cone.**

**Completion criterion — the numbers count only conjoined with a green gate.** `dropped by
P6` → **0**, `compared against Lean` → **265** (today **76**/**189**), **and**
`conf-tile:1/5 … 5/5` green. Both numbers are publishable with no Lean change at all, so the
state-gate control is what makes the criterion real (PROOF_STATUS `2026-08-16c`).
**Re-derive from `formal/FINAL_REVIEW.md`'s generated ledger, never prose** — thrice stale.

**Read first:** `PROOF_STATUS.md` `## Session 2026-08-20b` (adjudication, polarity census
§7, both sabotage records), scope doc §11.9 then **§11.10 (the traps)**, then
`GraphIndex/Scratch4cii.lean`, then §11.7 and §11.5. `2026-08-16c` and §11.8 are superseded
on the shadow question but stand as written — method, not state. Then
`ReconcileComplete.lean::reachedByW3aAdmitted_toW3a`,
`RulesComplete.lean::ReachedByRulesAdmitted`, `LeafRules.lean::GraphState.writeRulesRaw`,
`Cascade.lean::GraphState.writeLoggedOne`, `Leaf.lean::publicOfLeaf`,
`Exec.lean::foldAdmitsB`, `extractor.py::_edge_projection`.

### `P6` — `ttuStarFree` part (ii): bridges on the rule-routed write path

Materialise the in-bridge on the rule-routed write path so the widened star-freeness
predicate is actually inhabited.

⚠ **"It can run in parallel with `P3`" was WRONG, and this row carried it for weeks**
(corrected 2026-08-20b). Logically independent, **textually colliding**: both re-point
`RulesWrite.lean::writeRules` and `Cascade.lean::writeLoggedOne`, both move `FoldAdmits` +
`Exec.lean::foldAdmitsB` in lockstep, and **both pay the same 38-module cone** — whichever
lands second re-pays it. Land increment A (additive, zero-cone) and stop, or sequence B
after `P3`; never concurrently. **Probe with `#eval` before paying the cone, exactly as
`P3` did**: `CascadeStable.lean`'s `writeLeg_reach_stable` family says a write leg does not
change reachability at these nodes, and **an in-bridge DOES change reachability — that is
its purpose**, so those statements may go FALSE at a bridged state rather than merely
needing a new case. The change is also **INERT on every corpus** (measured 2026-08-20:
`bridged_in_shapes` empty on all 26 `corpus.SCHEMAS` and every extended set bar one,
fragment-excluded), so the gate cannot see it and all evidence must be new Lean pins —
[`docs/sabotage-procedure.md`](docs/sabotage-procedure.md) §"The INERT change" governs, as
for part (i). Increment B also **inverts
`extractor.py::_edge_projection`'s `P2` projection** (it drops PYTHON `w_any` rows because
"Lean never creates them"); its docstring is already false. Detail: ledger `2026-08-20b`.

⚠ **DO NOT DROP IT.** Without `ttuStarFree`, `graph_correct` and `backend_equivalence` are
machine-checked **FALSE** — not merely unproven. Part (i) is **INERT**: part (ii)
materialises the edge, and the rest of the leg is inert until it lands.
`W4Fragment.ttuStarFree` must stay **UNCHANGED** until (ii) is in.

**Read first:** `formal/CORRESPONDENCE.md` §7 (`ZT-P5-NEW`);
`UsStarWrite.lean::Schema.isStarTuplesetThrough` / `::Schema.isSubjectWildcardUserset`;
`ensureInBridges` / `ensureBridges`; `writeRules` / `writeLoggedRules`; `derive_schema_info`'s
second loop.

### `R6` — perf round 6: `R6-10` landed, nine remain

**`R6-10` landed 2026-08-20b** (both steps): `−60.7%` incremental boolean write wall,
**2.54×**, SQL statements/cycle `1929 → 822`. Remaining order: `R6-6` (4.75 → 1.75
statements per `check`) → `R6-11` → `R6-5` (**32.7%** ORM construction for 3–4 columns) →
`R6-4` → `R6-9` → `R6-18` (**53.1%** off the biggest table; owes a hand PG migration) →
`R6-16` → `R6-7`+`R6-8` → `R6-1`.

**Declined on an upper bound; do not reopen without new numbers:** `R6-15` (**0.9%**),
`R6-12` (**1.00×**), `R6-14` (**5.0%**), `R6-2`. **Unreachable by any benchmarked workload**
(`R6-3` = `R6-17`, bulk twin `R6-13` — 0 calls each): they need a `T:*#P` workload first.
`R6-19` owns the last unowned number (25.3% cumulative, **self 2.0%** — a call-site fan-out).

⚠ **Five traps the numbers do not carry** live in
[`perf-round6-audit-2026-08.md`](docs/perf-round6-audit-2026-08.md) §"Traps the numbers do
not carry", demoted there 2026-08-20b. **Read that section before taking an id.** Both
2026-08-20b corrections were fully applied 2026-08-21: `R6-11`'s "8×" is **~4×** in all four
places *and* the halving now lives in the instrument
(`benchmarks/profile_r6.py::_ctxmgr_entries`, which refuses an odd ncalls), re-confirmed at
`184 scopes / 40 reconciles = 4.6×` — verdict still `MOTIVATED`, only the size moved;
`R6-4(a)`'s unsound `(id, version)` memo is now flagged **in its own entry**, because the
fix sketch is a verbatim block that calls the key "sound".

**Read first:** [`R6_PROFILE_2026-08-17.md`](benchmarks/results/R6_PROFILE_2026-08-17.md)
(verdicts, method, the two limits — in-memory SQLite understates statement-count wins,
cProfile depresses throughput — and its three instrument corrections, whose transferable
rule is [`docs/sabotage-procedure.md`](docs/sabotage-procedure.md) §"A MEASUREMENT is an
assurance step too" and binds any re-run), then your id's entry in
[`docs/perf-round6-audit-2026-08.md`](docs/perf-round6-audit-2026-08.md) **including its
verifier corrections**, then [`docs/perf-next-round.md`](docs/perf-next-round.md) for the
fence and the reopening rule. Re-run with `python -m benchmarks.profile_r6 [_write]
--target <t>` — never beside another bench or pytest run.

## Standing traps

Cross-item only. Everything durable and repo-wide lives in `CLAUDE.md` instead.

* ⚠ **Do NOT lift `ttuDirect` in Lean.** It is load-bearing for the current admission
  story; the open descendant is row `DW-1`, and nothing is blocked meanwhile.
* ⚠ **Status lines inside `docs/history/` and `formal/history/` are frozen as-of-then**,
  and several are known false. Read them for method, never for state.

The `.scratch/`-is-lossy and cite-a-real-symbol traps moved to `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-08-20b.

## Rhythm

The end-of-session write-back. Steps 0–3 are the **mandatory floor**; if context runs
short, list every skipped step-4/5/6 action *verbatim* under `Still owed:` and the next
session executes it before its own work. A skip that leaves no trace is how the last
accretion started.

0. **Run `python scripts/handoff_lint.py`** before committing any board edit.
1. **Append one entry to [`docs/history/session-log.md`](docs/history/session-log.md)** —
   every session, no exceptions. Ledger first, so the banner has a key to cite.
2. **Rewrite the Banner**: gate state as observed, today's date, the new headline, and the
   entry key you just created.
3. **Edit the board in place.** Flip `pri`; touch `moved` on every row you worked, not
   only the ones you re-ranked; delete closed rows **and sweep their ids out of every
   `deps` cell**; rewrite the item block of every touched `NOW`/`NEXT` item, read-first
   list included.
3b. **Do not restate gate counts in prose.** They live in `formal/FINAL_REVIEW.md`'s
   generated block and are machine-checked by `verify.sh` step 4e; regenerate with
   `python -m formal.conformance.doc_counts --generate`. This file went stale three
   separate times by keeping its own copies (`ZT-P3-5`).
4. **File method lessons in their runbook now** — the ledger entry summarises and points.
5. **Fix wrong docs in place now.** Living doc → edit it; FROZEN or ACTIVE-PLAN → append a
   dated correction at the top. **This board never hosts a correction to another doc.**
6. **New traps** → the owning item's block, or `CLAUDE.md` if durable and repo-wide.

Before starting anything: `bash formal/verify.sh lean` should be green in ~60 s warm. If
it is not, fix that first — it is the fastest signal in the repo.
