may break the API. The newest version heading must equal `zanzibar.__version__`
(`tests/test_tk122_release_metadata.py`).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1]

First packaged release: a trial of the release pipeline (tag -> gate -> fuzz -> PyPI),
not a stability promise.

### Added
- The `zanzibar` package: `zanzibar.schema` (OpenFGA-DSL parser and compiler, including
  `and` / `but not`), `zanzibar.setengine`, `zanzibar.graphindex` and
  `zanzibar.connectedstore`.
- Apache-2.0 licence, `py.typed` marker, PyPI metadata.

### Changed
- All database tables are prefixed `zanzibar_` (`node` -> `zanzibar_node`, ...), as are the
  explicit constraint and index names. The tables no longer set `extend_existing`, so a
  name clash with an application's own table raises instead of silently merging the two.
  This is a schema change for any existing database. There is no migration: rebuild the
  store from its tuples.
